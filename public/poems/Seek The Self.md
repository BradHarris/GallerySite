Breath the hope
know the truth
Seek the self
and be the wearing

Sinew is at best
the heart of yearning
Tips of tops
and breathing past
the bark that won't stop burning

Roots of core
and seeking out
the trails that won't stop luring
Travel past
discover fast
for the truth won't stop enduring

Spirit that travels
the mind and heart
so quick so fast to find the one within
the future the past
together at last
while the trunk stands stock still

Sparkling rich
this mother earth
who returns her dead into the living
one chance
to travel this one within
with a life so short and full
the earth wears places so known and so true
but will never be known so true
without the known inside of you

Breath the hope
know the truth
seek the self
and be the wearing
