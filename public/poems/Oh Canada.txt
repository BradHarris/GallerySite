My heart is bent inside
In a silent shock it breaks for you
In what we do in far away places
And then my mind is bent inward
Trying to hear into the hushed up world
Of what was said and what was meant
And when and why depending on the time
And what went by and what is remembered
And the silence is too loud
And the silence is too
Disorderly And
All that's heard Are the lists and the done's
And the
Manifests of their destiny
But the entertainment is what shuffles you all around
The mindlessness is what silences
 
All that was said and decided in the name of democracy
Was not mine
I want no part of this war, I'm climbing down
My voice is not heard and out of 
All the Four Races of White and Black and Yellow and Red
The red voice is missing
There is an imbalance to this multi cultural land that represents the world
Fear is the conduit to numbed down silence
And democracy is the peaceful opposite to war not the reason for it
Cause no one really needs to die in that far away place
The truth is shifting inside
As you feel Autumn and your leaf falling
It's like the white clouds that morph and take over the blue
I've sat on this white background for forty two years
I've been the spirit and the blood and the red earth that went into this red leaf
I sprang from the standing ones
But it was never acknowledged that I was the spirit of this red on this fabric
 
The Red has been like a decoration but never lived like one
And has been accused of dying but we are still living while suicides and poverty mock us
Yet as much as the past hurts and as much as the present burns
There is more which makes me want off this fabric
The fish are dying and the land is being drilled and the North is melting
As the sky leaks out harmful rays
The winds are roaring and the waters are overflowing
The ground is parched and forests clear cut at the same time they are burning
I do not want to watch this earth writhe in pain
When all the choices were made without my say
Now we are at war in a country thousands of miles away
For the same purpose our blood splattered over 500 years ago today
I'm climbing down, I'm climbing down, I'm climbing down.
