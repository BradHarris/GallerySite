It all starts with that seed inside your mind
Knowing who you are and where you’re from
Your ancestors buried on this land make it sacred
Your roots run from them
And how you see inside your mind
To know where to grow

Reaching to know yourself and grow from what sprang from them
Over years and round cycles
That blew in from storms from western skies
And thunderbeings who strike across horizons
In morning’s that shine on you to see
That weathering on through
Were the sacred roots that kept you grounded
So you could still reach for the fall the place pointed to
That created what was needed for the next season

The end but the beginning
The beginning from an ending
The never ending circle
The loop that ends where it starts
The love we take for granted
The place we own but are not allowed inside
The seed at the end of a season the period at the end of an exclamation
A power that starts compact in the end dot
Of who am I is who I am like the seed of a tree who knows who its going to be
A gift a thought a night a dream the end before the morn
I am what I held all along.
