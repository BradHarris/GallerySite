Sky of Totems
floating past
earth's passion
in a blue.

Animal totems
feathery light,
a billowy sight,
reminding us
of animals
drifting away,
then changing form,
gone forever
lost in a storm.

Are we the last
to drift away
to be gone forever
lost in a storm?

Careful passengers
in azure.
Careful riders
with Mother Earth.

Stretch this vision
of ourselves
before we all drift away.
