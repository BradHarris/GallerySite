A sun's rays reflect upon a grandmother as she ascends weeping into the night 
That Grandmother moon has moved their ebbing tides of their cycles in their lives 
As mother's and grandmother's and families mourn tears never heard 
That over thirty years can pass and sisters go missing are murdered disappear 
A lost number over six hundred but no body reads about it nobody hears 
Anishinabe Kwewag you were the seed from the original dream 
Born into a cycle of stolen hearts Anishinabe Kwewag women are slain 
Young and some troubled hunted in their weakness and pains 
Daughters hunted as they look up to find their way out into a world they didn't make 
Hunted as their parents heal inside from an ache in a tortuous historical colonized quake 
Broken over a history of shattered families 
That splintered on that last blanket, that cloth, that robe, those weapons of mass destruction 

Trying to destroy the Earth's keepers, the Anishinabe Creators, the healers 
The ones with the least rights then any other Woman living in Canada 
Daughters and Mothers are hunted with a quietly discounted red racist past 
Hunted in that wound that silence would mask 
Perpetrated on every ancestor North and South from every sunrise East to last 
Hundreds of years stolen, thousands of years now look back 
A generation passes into the dust, lost, dropped into a sunset 
They are not looked for, not on paper, a bandwidth, a satellite 
Thirty years have come and gone and a people who still heal are left to mourn 

And I wonder who hunts the young the weak the vulnerable, who does this to a lost child 
And when these children are disregarded not searched for 
By those in dominant places in all our son's command 
Enfranchised to own in the many fest destiny of their absolution 
Who holds their debt to the powers of their irresponsibility? 
For if you live in this power you live in that debt; 
To the lives stolen, killed and raped 
To the lost and broken families 
To the lost cultures 
To the history of lies in textbooks 
A corrupt government dies in the greed it was conceived in 
From a true democracy stolen the day the order changed into all our son's command 
For the Anishinabe kwewag were once valued in a sovereignty that respected the women 
Valued as decision makers as the heart of her nation 
As wisdom keepers, negotiators, visionaries, seers, the nurturers, 
Women were honoured like the waters we are born into and out of 
In the life giving voice that caresses the memory of formation 
Not subject or slave not sexualized or demonized not silenced or disrespected
