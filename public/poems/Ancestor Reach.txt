Ancestors reach us
on a silent coldness
on a pulse that speaks
with conviction and boldness.

Words of gold circling this orb
reach down
inside us
to help us
and guide us.

The world without spirit
does not exist
as Mother Earth's creations
woo us with connectiveness.

And as the rings unfold
in the grains of old
a story becomes
of what was hidden,
then told.

The words of our ancestors
awaken our day
permit a path
in a solid way.

In the beat of the heart
aged eyes chime,
a message of waiting
rests in the rings of time.

They've paced our path
and know our sweat
their tears have swelled
their cries were met
relations who came
who reached in time
guided and helped the
next ones in line.

They've been here before
they know our dreams
what we're to finish
readied prior to beginning.

They reply when we cry
and teach when we search
and touch when we reach
lives here on earth
our kin's resolve.
