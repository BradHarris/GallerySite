Inside a black sky where we never divide
But by a reflection I can see what flashes by
What was always there in the progression of time
At some point we fell asleep again
Did we ever open our eyes before the story ended
Not to be echoed again
 
And the water stains our hearts to remember what we thirst for
What we beat inside and pump for
It is the thunder in our hearts that we hide from
That silvery moon that we pine under
That 13th big spirit moon there to purify us and heal all Creation
And the lightening and rain nourishes us with pure energy
Blue moon may take three months spiritual journey
To receive the healing powers of the Universe
And transform our own vision of truth
That the warrior women would lead the way
 
And as Grandmother Moon lights the night sky
Lights the Earth with her cerebral reflection
We remember not to hide from our own thunder or our flash of lightening
In a male dominated world that keeps our womenâ€™s tongues submissive
As our men struggle to heal
We remember her light as we once were.
 
Thunderbeings and Grandmother Moon unite
Warrior women know it is time
Silvery blue grandmother moon
Dark sky recesses rumble messages to you
Of breaking the cycle of violence to our women.
