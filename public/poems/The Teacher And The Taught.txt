The teacher takes
What is gathered
Gives around
Spreads it out
Till it's taught

Through eyes, ears, tongue
It is weaved in and out
A living spirit of learning
Of giving and taking
Understanding the key of the flow to sending it back
And the teaching teaches the teacher once more

The teacher takes what has been returned
Gathers it up
And gives some more
Spending it back
Spreading it around
Into the eyes
Bound by the ears
The mind sorts it through
And conveys it to tongue

The eyes and ears do what must be done
To mind the keeper
And grows from what is offered
Becomes bigger, wants more
This cycle continues into new circles of learning

What an honour to be a teacher
To plant so much into so many terra firma
And never be able to look back
To know the return
What seeds multiplied into what fertile fields
Harvested into ripeness from a single seedling
Gives homage to the teacher
In the brightness of a red teaching

And so it is with the Creator
Who gives and grows
Newness each day
That all that is offered
Would be honoured
With a red return to teachings
