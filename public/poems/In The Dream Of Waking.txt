I dream in the time of sleep
When even a Grandmother Moon
Didn't see Father Sun Coming
Or was it more that she didn't notice he hadn't moved
And it was she who had moved closer
As she climbed my hill
She stays in the sky sleeping still
Even while her sun is close by

And as we lay there sleeping
We dream of waking
Of doing and moving and becoming more
But we will one day collide
That morning into knowing the meaning of the dream
And what the day light is for.
