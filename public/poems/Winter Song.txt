Winter songs were the hardest to learn.
Its cold breath bore the meaning
of struggle and ice
of problems and work
scarring the hands and hearts
that carry us

And as the wind blows
and our air froze
we try to hang on
to what scars us
tears through the soul
ripping into
a nights eye.

And the cutting ice
lost lesson?
Winter masks its white pain
making it easy
to blame others.

And here comes the refrain.
You've heard this one before.
It always asks
the same wrong question,
Why have you messed with me?
Oh why me?
and why did you do this to me?

Oh illusion;
pointing the fault
of winter's mountain,
keeping
our struggle of problems at bay,
gripping for something
to hold on to.

But the mountain
keeps moving,
too slippery
it slices us
then shatters
from the strain
too hard, too painful to climb.
Someone else's mountain usually is.

But look over there!
She climbs outside
and grips firmly the mountain
that is part of her.

She owns her grip
and knows her climb
is the one she grew.

For she has learned
the hardest song of winter,
the one where the ending
is very close to the beginning.

No room for excuses
or someone else to blame.

She knows where she ends
and where she begins.
No one interrupts
this song she sings.

A cycle of learning
that melts directly into spring
is a self sowing lesson.
