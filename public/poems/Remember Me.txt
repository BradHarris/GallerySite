When you come to rest here
Remember where you came from
And who you are
Because I hold you as you grow
I am Earth Mother
Your home

Remember me
When you are sick and hurting
I will be your healer, making you well
My body will heal yours
With plants, sun, air and water
I am Mother Earth
Your medicine

Remember me
When you are hungry
And you need sustenance
My body will be your life
Lay down your tobacco
And give thanks for what you take
I am Mother Earth
And I will provide what you are needing

Remember me
When you are lonely
And I will send winged ones
To sing to you and lighten your heart
And other creatures
To calm and love you
My body is home to the living like you
I am Earth Mother
Home to all

Remember me
When you are dying
My body will embrace yours
As my silt covers you over
'Til you are a part of me
And I, blend into you
Then your soil will help others to grow
When your spirit returns to our Creator
Remember
You will always be here, a part of me
I am Mother Earth

So remember
To take care of me
Lay down your tobacco
Feast me
And I will provide for you and your children's children's children
