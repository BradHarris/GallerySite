Behind the robes
that deny,
Deny the very space
you reside,
Uncover from that place
where you hide
and reveal the wisdom
that grew you.

For though you were taken,
you now return,
And though you return,
you move on,
And though you've moved on,
you pray,
And though you've prayed,
you must now listen.

Enveloped in the wings of Eagle,
who see and carry your prayers above,
he returns to see,
and cover with
the honour of his wing.
Oh precious ones
who walk with purpose,
to see,
there is
no need to hide.

And as the blue opens
to reveal a place
no need to hide.
As the young know
life becomes the living
as the living becomes the life.

Presence became her
one day
after the days of hiding.
Moving on
she became
the relevant silence.
Unwrapping her family who grew her,
who hid themselves
but grew her distance.

She became;
the coming and the going,
the hidden and the revealed,
the given and the received,
the place and the destination,
the future and the past,
the cleaved and the released,
the closed and the open,
the answer in the promise!

Her cry?
No Need To Hide.
The circle is complete.
The blue has opened.
Our coming IS our going.
Our place is our destination.
For our future is covered in our past,
and what was hidden,
now is revealed.
What was given,
is now being received.
For what was confused as complex
has fused to one.

It was traveling through the hoop,
the doorway that confounded,
that grew the past,
and moved the future
into one.
