Gliding and shining
Liquid longings reflecting
The sun and the moon
Connected down each wave
Each ripple
Each tide
Spirit of the water
Lives in each one
Survives in each love
That cries tears wet
From eyes that see the pain of hurting each other
From clouds that rained drops of growth
From babies that came screaming into the living
From waters made of their mothers
Spirit of her water lives in you
