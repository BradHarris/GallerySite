From where she rests
She is surely to fall
Amid the fire backdrop
For that is what
The winds tell her
And to move on

So she sings this magic
That to flow with the winds of change
Is to camouflage your young
And so she rests
So securely inside the crest
Of Mother Earth

But it is her blackness
That holds the world as one
And her yellow gaze that lights it
For she sees what the sun has brought
In clouds of colour
It is the goodness of possibility she sees
Through her blackness out of her yellow

And as she moves the world
With every beat of her wing
She becomes one with the curve
Of the earth's turn
And the beat of the earth heat her drum
A world so complete
Is what she sees
