Reaching far, searching deep
...
or was it running?

A truth of young and old
of seeds and spirits and breaths untold.

Some,
never complete the deed
know their reason
or live to hear their breath be told.

Their reason,
was meant to be played out in dreams
and conscious days,
told into their cells,
known clear in spirit,
forgotten upon first slap.

This cycle: birth - life - death
vests a design into each direction.
Someone emerges over time,
scarred and wounded
having far too much outside
they are pocked with holes
to stave off the hunger within.

Scarred and wounded
crave, far too much
the stimulants, of excess.
Senses of the body;
do you to ever sense
or hear within.

Poor brave souls
who hunger and thirst;
you are like the rich
with a storm.
You thunder and bellow
and rain tears of sorrow
but the true sound
is in the silence after growth.

You finally starve the wants
and stand still to feed the needs.
Hear, into the quiet
the cell returns

or so it seems
but wasn't it always there
and only you
who left running.
Did not notice
that you rejected
the life and people you were given?

What is this meaning
of played out potential?
A life
we search
to absorb?
We are given
only to reject?
and then know
to learn?

For what is the message we need
to complete our living design.

To honour what was given
is to learn from the known
and discover
the cell - the message - our home.

To understand home
is like a feather that
slices inside.
The pain is lessened
only with a sacred view
of where we began is where we'll end.

Reaching far, searching deep,
A truth of young and old
of seeds and spirits and breaths untold
quiets the ones who know,
To return that breath
now told
as a life of played out potential
are spirits of gold.
