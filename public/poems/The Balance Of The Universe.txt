In a milky way
She balances and holds
Grandfather Sun
Mother Earth, Grandmother moon
And all the planets in place spinning
Over and over again
Our Mother spins and circles around Grandfather
Renewing her day, changing her seasons
While Grandmother spins and circles around her daughter
Lighting her nights and moving her waters


The balance of the Universe is in her gravity
She holds it all together
While all the stars look on
From millions of years ago
They were the rocks of history
They know the time in space we are in now
And look on with their fiery stares


But in the lightness of the day
We are only present now
And know not of their histories
But when our night does come
And we move to the other side
Will we then know the reason of her order
And how we fit
The balance of the Universe
Why do our lives remain tightly coherent
While all the stars who look on
Were dimmed so long ago


For seeing in a sacred manner is their memory of our beginning.
Their time is measureless and yet their time is over.
Our time is so limited and yet we continue to see them glow.
As the Universe balances our lives with the stars memories
Will our endings too shine on forever?
