The masks I wear
on this earth journey
are fleshed out paths
of my home

The shields that protect me
are the helpers and guardians
that have girded me
thus far

Shielding bear
lone wolf,
who run with her pack
clothe this
courageous silent child
now enamored mother
with their prayerful elixir
these spirit helpers
who guide me to
the conscious unknown
of becoming

A purpose becomes
the fabric of my life
The design unfolds
into a pattern
and I the sewer
within its draped meaning
stitch together the fibre
of it's spirit

Spring was the coolness
inside the warmth
of parent's arms.
Until summers heat
broke free
into family.
Now fall
it's cool again,
sewing each layer
becomes
the warmth
to someone small.
Colder still, Winter
even the branches are empty
accept for the white.

I seek out my layers
my spirit helpers
all the seasons of my life
all the reasons for my work
and I wear the fabric
of my making
that I've sewn
each day

I sense my mortality
above
as she descends upon me
a white weathered friend
she soars closer
with her
winter secrets
of the warm inside the cold
the white under a dark sky
the smoothness of the wrinkled
the calm inside the storm

I don't mind her look
I align myself with her stealth
and connect my spirit
to her storm.

Sheltered by the nap of her wing
I feel my heart rock
and steady myself
for winters door

With all the masks and shields
that carry me
in this cold season
I will be ready
to shed this cloth
to earths floor.
