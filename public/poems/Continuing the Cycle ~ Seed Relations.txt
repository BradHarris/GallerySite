Just a little seed you see
Sailing on a breeze
Is going to make a difference
Once she takes hold
Of her Mother

Breaking open
Grabbing hold
Reaching down and out
Stretching up and out
Into the sky
Leafing out
Is what she's about to do

But for now resting
On her outer shell
In her mother's hand
Drifting along
Waiting to sprout up on the land

I'm gonna make a difference she says
I'm a little seed that can
I'm gonna find some Mother Earth
And bury myself in the sand
I'm gonna make a difference you see
Just you watch me suc-seed
I've floated along and drifted
And a little piece of earth is all I need

Drifting on her mother's hand
She's shed her shell
And can hardly wait to land
But as the breeze powers her way
She never knows
Which tack the wind will go

So she sings her song;
'I'm gonna make a difference
It's time to settle down
It's time to grow up high the sky
It's time to root low
Down the ground
It's time to branch out
Drop my seeds about
Oh just you wait and see
I'm gonna make a difference
Once I nestle inside
My Mother's tummy'

In the bay
Along the way
She sees her family on a hill
On turtle's back

Where it rains and shines
Her family see her coming
And wave to greet her
As she comes their way

She knows she will be
One more to wave across the land
One more to greet a floater across the way
One more to grow and give in the wind
One more to offer home to the wingeds
One more to give shade on a summer's day
One more to clear the air
One more to sprinkle seeds
And continue
And as the wind will always be her captain
The sun; her way to up
The rain; her life blood
Mother Earth, always her Mother
She will be
One more to wave, greet, grow offer, give, clear, Sprinkle, and continue
Before melting into the Mother
That nurtured her
