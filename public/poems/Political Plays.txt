So what was it first
That caught my eye?
The billowy curtain
In Red & White?
Disappearing faces
Turning left then right?

The backwards ride on clans
Picked by the white?
Which were they to ride?
An angry pit bull in radical red
Or a pretty pony in pumped up plum?

But who knew who chose
When the angry pit bull won
Who demanded his vote in court
As a discount son
Then sewed discord
Draped in red and white,
A brother lodged him in tight
And it begins
On this merry-go-round ride
The show of all shows
The amazing race to the other side

Amusement and gains are fused at Another's folly
Betrayal is the ride
Lost in the drapery
Speaking either sided
On a democratically frayed divide
A dog and pony show prevails.

Who are these that would
Bring on a war
Demand to get in
By honing another's gore
And then gouging the score
Claim themselves a win

Who are these
That would alter events
To accomplish their own
Made popular
By a crash and burn
And as many became the fallen dust
In a sea of glass and fire
They did not look twice

Two towers plunge
And where was
The smirking one
But there,
Far down south
Safely in a classroom
Staged being found
Next to the innocent.

Who is this great deceiver?
Who thinks democracy is not what
The many want
But decides as an elite,
Of who shall stay
And who shall leave.
Who is this, are these
Who would
Decide the fate of many
Working up fears
With high alerts
Commanding borders
Who dictates what is said
And what is written
All justified within the brackets of The Patriot and Protectionism

And where are they all marching to
Whose children lithe and small
To fight,
Martyrs made for one and oil?

A strategy to rally
The many against the few
Who knew before
But later hunted down
All the brown

And how many more will it cost
Whose children, husband, sister, brother
Whose father mother
Will not return
And how many stories will we hear
To stir,
Disturb, stabbing fear

The fervor mass cry to level mountains, kill and die
And oh how the fear
Will bring about
A popular president
And wasn't he
Just so rallied about

And then what is it
That becomes of a world
Who is used to looking at what is
Square, flat, and two dimensional
Who do not
Question motives behind the shine
Or what lies dormant
About to strike
Who forget history
Even though they lived through it

Who will gain from these tragedy's
Who has motive of opportunity
Who pays back their funders
Of oil and security
With prejudices and powers
Riches and lives
Who chooses how this earth will die,
Who will be in darkness
And who will survive?

And when he was building his house
With his father's old wood
Why did none question
A papa's agenda
A father and son tag team
Of unfinished business

And even though they said
He never knew
Never had a clue
A Saudi King said
He gave him the news
Many months too soon
And later
The proof was made
In his pudding

Thank Goodness
There are no more Georges
To proliferate
To pound their way
Unless a another
Comes out of the Bush
To reveal his bones

A grand papa promotes an Adolf
A father; Saddam and Bin Laden
And a son sucks the rest dry
While the carnival rides by
And Mother Earth is
Fueled to die
And the world looks on
That will, in the end
Be our nemesis

So what was it first
That caught my eye?
That crisscrosses waters for a second time
What has changed
Red's now Brown
'Evil' swaps a 'Heathen'
While White lies stir fears
A merger for Manifest Destiny
To obtain what is not theirs
Changing rules all the while
And the only hope
Is for a Donkey Ride!
