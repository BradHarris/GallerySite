In the time of midnight, in Waboose the time of the North; Winter and White
We have snow upon our hair as newborns come to life
In the time of seeds frozen within our Mother, it is an energy for the next season
When things seem to be sleeping yet it is a lie of energy that burgeons beneath her skin
In the time of the North, Fourth age of skin
When our bodies slow and take the silence of wisdom into our night
Into the darkness of our quiet dreams, then feast them on tomorrow's happenings
Like seed pods of our minds, slowing frozen seeds into the resting place
For growing into knowing of another new day
 
It is a time of peace and a time of power for our Spirits
A time of forgiveness and a time of compassion for our hearts
For all around is the surrender of small pieces of ourselves in body and mind
As the Spirit grows stronger in visions known into dreams
And our hearts grow passionate knowing the imperfections
That delineate in shadows one thing from another
Waboose is both the ending and the beginning of the great circle of life that continues the cycle
Influencing all the moons of the northern quadrant, from December to March
Even though she appears to be dead, she is merely storing the energy for new life
For when we are infants we give away all the love we gained in the world before life
Like Sweetgrass seeds grown from the deep riches of  Earth
Soaking up the deepest parts, crack open then wave to the sun
Braided as mother's hair, burned into smoke calling on the good ones
 
The power of Waboose is knowing
From girl to woman to mother and grandmother
As my body goes into the earth and my mind waves into the sky
A progression of  wisdom covers me since my beginning
Grandmother Moon, Mother Earth, Women are relations of Creation
Creators into the Spirit of the South sharing her beat that travel in seeds
Across the lower spectrums, like a heartbeat, a pulse connecting us
Till Grandmother moon holds up a hand and tells us our Creative time is done
East through West controlling our tides
In a circle of her hand she stops what she began
My body as child, youth and adult, has shared this skin and hair now fading to white
In Sweetgrass braids I witness my night, in this spirit I've known my whole life
I will return from Waboose in the time of midnight
With visions of women who dream in the North but wing to the West
We are in the time of measuring our journey in feathers as we prepare for our leaving
When our body becomes the Earth joining with a Mother who fed us, we are again what feeds others
Into this circle of giving back we become the cycle of what is new in the hands of Spring
As we melt into the earth our life dies to live on into another's new cycle
That at an age that pines for the East with the power of seeds, Creation sees how far we've come
From that time of an egg to a heartbeat that flew out from her shell
Transforming many times inside my same skin, I never lost the love of my horizons 
For who could not love the journey and the in between questions  Of; What was dreamt and what was given, what have I done and where have I been to: The journey's not over and where am I going?
