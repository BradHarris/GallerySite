I'm in the winter of my December moon
Where Little Spirit Moon, Mnid-ooGii-zoons
The Twelfth moon of Creation lives
Into the long night and short day
Where I say Miigwetch to my season
Diminishing into the West
And my life turns again into beginnings
As she the East Direction blows away my cycle
And my seeds become an empty mask of what went before
Pass on through the West Door
Little Spirit Moon knows the cold of my season
With my children grown and growing all around my directions
Eagle protects and carries messages and prayers down the Blue way
So I know the turns of this Earth will see many more creations
Along my Red Road
Beyond the sweet ones who once grew inside my belly.
