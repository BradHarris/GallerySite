In a fiery tongue
A vibration is heard
In the centre of your soul
Re-Awakening the Songs of continuum

A cry
Like your heart has known
Long before it was beating
An ache
Like your spirit has sown
Before joining and leaving
It remembers
How the birds have sung
It knows
And waits to unite that weeping seedling with the memory of before

The language
That brings together
Scorches your heart
Digs at your feet
Rouses your spirit
Settles your mind
Remembers its tongue
Is the language of the heart

It turns on a beat
And returns again
To seal your fate
You see
You have come under its spell
And seeing in a sacred manner
You remember
The heart is like the drum
Re-awakened by song.
