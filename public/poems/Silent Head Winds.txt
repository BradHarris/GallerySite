Passing into going through
what doesn't seem
but is,
what pushes against
but streams,
what circles around
but goes through,
what doesn't appear hard
but which the soul labours.

And as always
there it is
this hardness we become
as we go through it
what no one else perceives
what nobody else can see
passing into going through
our own
silent head winds.
