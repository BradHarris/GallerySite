To hold back time
Is to hold all the drops
In place
Before they fall
Or stop what could be
Because of the past
And then lose today

Hummingbird can
Stop dead whilst whipping at high speed
Hummingbird's medicine is adaptability
To not fritter away moments being in the past
But get inside the moment
And suck the nectar from today

Hummingbird's message is inner joy
The joy deep inside
But to confine that magnificent, free, loving energy
Would be to endure immense misery
And thoughts of hopelessness
Hummingbird must fly free
In the pursuit of beauty,
Scattering joy and love to all it touches
But who would hold back Hummingbird
When the Earth must spin in its own time

The spirit world
Knows no time
Amidst the clouds
Being part of the rain
The flow between fish
The wind which shape the clouds
The moment split between seconds

Ancestors
On the other side
Try to touch us
Through clouds that
Get in the way
Theirs is the promise
Of our future
As they guide us
On our Red Road

They are on the other side
Looking in
While we locked in time
Feel every drop
Watch the wind move the clouds
While time spindled by the sun
Becomes un-spun in memories
As time like water drips away
