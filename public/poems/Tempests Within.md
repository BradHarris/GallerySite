Is the Earth down below
Where you feed from and need some?
Do her cycles connect into you
To remember the storms are yours?
That divide you and your soul into trying to remember
From which smell of the rain on what wind it was sent from?
Is that the place where you scream from?
That place of the joining where your dreams come
Where the winds blow some?
One can never say what hope got lost in a trance
What story died with an old one's parlance
This is the dance that despair lives in
Of trinkets and pockets, filling and drilling
Emptying then restocking, in parties and feasts
While typhoons spin whining
When lessons of breaching the teachings
Float up on sides of mammals beaching
Polar Bears drift by, slide down dying
Eyes blinking wide up to the skies
For that's where the debris keeps seeping
Down through the atmospheric tides of our keeping
Thunder beings haunt warning up high
In a blaze in the evening sky
Where thirst and hunger lie sleeping
And it's too hard to live, in these hot dry places
Water left drying on red parched skin cracking
A land so well hid, we peek out soft handed
Fringe of it swills inside a hidden hell
And they remain resting inside a shell
Too many comforts, don't bother to hear those who yell
She only looks back at you now
From that place you've made her so unwell
You've sucked her dry while puffing up your lapel
And all around the earth is in cataclysm
Do you not see it's your heart and soul reflection
To be her life support connection?
Is the Earth down below?
