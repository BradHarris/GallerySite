To know the gentleness of the deer, the elk, the caribou, the moose dancing with electric eyes 
Caribou goes a little crazy in heart and storm, in this dance of the night 
Caribou loses his land and his life into extinction, without a fight 
Dancing to continue over half die out to less then one hundred, are gone in one generation 
As a blight the size of Florida finds its money, in Alberta sands 
It is the big Oil companies that come and kill this land, the Anishinabe live off 
The fish, and birds die, are left with tumors and cancers, and the waters and land, toxic 
Peoples are buried into the cries that can't undie 
Taking away family from a people, the corporation is the cancer 
With no remorse leaching into the once potable Athabasca 
There seems no plans to change this, no recourse 

Dancing with electric eyes is to know the poets, the artists, the philosophers of the land 
Who see and speak the truth that lay spoiled in front of the sleeping 
Creating, they waken the stories, become the record keepers 
I hear it in my mind that change comes from visions of the visionaries 
I hear it in my heart that the universe listens to these prayers 
I hear it in my spirit that we are all connected to this knowledge 
I hear it in my hand that I create in this understanding with this same water 
On these trees that grew from seeds of promise, I try to echo what was lost 
But we are only human beings and the corporation is not 

As my left knee comes up it holds my fears and humbleness in turned in toes 
My right knee holds my foot to the ground keeps my spirit name Turtle Shadow Woman 
My wolf clan inspirits me underneath to dance for who I belong to 
One hundred and seventy five years ago my grandmothers said prayers for me 
I dance in the waters my great grandmothers protected for me seven generations into now
I am their granddaughter an Anishinabekwe with the responsibility of the water 
I am that caribou dancing for my great grandchildren seven into the future 
Even though it took the ones of greed just two generations to undo 
What my Ancestors kept since their Creation 
What the Creator conceived over 3.9 billion years 
I know no divides to this land I call Mother.
