I never saw you coming
wolf
as elk
was your disguise.

With gentle words
you took
as your own
my gift
to your second child.

I never saw you taking
as you heaved
inside my den
making your ears
like eagles' eyes,
you absorbed my very light.

My deer helper
sensed you first,
something
of an other nature
made her
straighten fast.

But, Speaking with
this gentle voice
I thought you did say 'friend'
and yet
Hearing with
another voice
I heard
my wolf helper
calling you
'fiend' instead

and yet

my howling friend
you struck with a plea
your heart on bended knee
you sucked me dry.

And then,
owls admonition
in my heart at first;
'nooooooo'
and later that night
on the pillow
of dreams;
'STOP',
but I believed
your disguise,
and heeded
too late
the warnings
of my spirit helpers,
upon seeing your
prized possession
mounted on your wall.

But I've forgiven you,
my wolf friend,
as I know
it's SO unlike a wolf
unless
he's desperate and
out of balance.
