Relations honours my relations to my Ancestors, my First Nations Clans, Animal and Plant and Seed relations, Wind, Birds, Water and Women relationship and Gitche Manito. Here I felt it is part of my journey to greet these relations in a formal way and although not all the relations are mentioned, Earth Prayers goes hand and hand with Relations as we are connected to all of Earth's living creatures and I wanted to establish this acknowledgment of these beings and clans as a journey to re-connect in a larger way to first beginnings of all that is around me, a greeting with respect.
