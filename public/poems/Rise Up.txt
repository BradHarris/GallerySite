When Fire Made Smoke
He rose up through her like a messenger
His life transformed came like a prayer from her
Of Peace after charred remains and at an age that could not find reason
She could only find treason, so she burnt inside out for him
And she said to him,
'Rise up out of the ashes as many times as you find that spark that keeps you alive'
And that fire became smoke like a Spirit Messenger into the air
And spoke of all the wounded stories that have stared off
From deep inside the mind's eye and speak for miles into the sky
In Blue to White inside a cloud's prayer North to the Creator
Seen from far below of how the Heart and Spirit of life can disappear
 
Given it was lit, from red to blue released then sent
Carrying the past into dreams of I knew you
And I am because of how I grew from the warmth of stories beside you
And the ones who fought for what they knew
Had kept the stories close and raw in words that traveled a clear view
But time has a way of hardening those words down to a few
And then adding more that are untrue
Like those from a hot age that kept burning anew
When smoke overwhelms a world who can't hear
Minds close into a coward's curl of what's justified and smoothed into whirls
And then fire and smoke become the lovers that hate brokered
And the wars that are started in that embrace become too painful to choke down
Where lies are flung and a people are kept in poverty and
The heart loses its battle to speak a tongue of truth when voices are smothered
 
When all that's heard cannot be repeated and all that's done is mistreated
And the tradition of story cannot be carried through from the places where they originally grew
When books are bound up and shelved into the pureness of children's minds
So that living side by side on white pages means telling lies
When history is burned up and never learned up on the edges of each of the white centuries
And what keeps getting stolen are the stories of the children on those red pages
Hunted, stolen, shaved and beaten, torn inside their minds, raped and killed and buried
For refusing the a b c's and one two three's on white pages in those same schooled places
Where those bound up could not find reason and passion honed into one
Of heart and mind living side by side like smoke and fire and like the sun
Then those stories must
'Rise up out of the ashes as many times as you find that spark that keeps you alive'
And find the Four races speaking in a dream that one was missing in its team
Like the thunder needed for the lightning,
For all the voices were being heard except for the Red Fire
That this history is better written and taught in the thunder who grew up around its strike.
