Carried by Eagle in a protective grip, I saw my ideas upside down, sleeping, looking back
Of where I'd been and what happened, my beginnings, the promise I made to myself
Before I'd lose them in swirls of growing up
But I was grateful for a grandmother's safety, keeping my spirit side whole
And I was thankful for a world that still managed to spin its twirl


And then something happened that jarred me awake
It seems dieing revived my living, back into the dream state
Saying that dream won't last 'Till days are done, beaten by the morning's sun
It startled my senses to climb into here,
Where time is measured and limited by fate and our actions are something only we can make


Loss informed worth by reaching back to heart like hummingbird sucking what time is red
Like the sweet I remember by my mother's breast, like all the gifts I was given which led
To potential spirits of could be's and might be's and possibilities
Waiting to be together in one breath, in one hand, in one step, on one land
What is possible beyond breathing is a lifetime; not much, not all, but which is enough
What I can give because I'm alive, is my life; not much, not all, but which is enough


These were the lights I was seeing in a sacred manner, like sparks of imagining,
The shape of all things in the Heyoke spirit of fun, what could be, if...
If metamorphic dreaming became the realness of a monarch preening
If Blue Bird flying flew me into the blue again and showed me, right side up the truth of trying,
That there was no fear of dying
If I only looked down to see I was looking up, I'd know that all the downs in life are teachings to fly up.
