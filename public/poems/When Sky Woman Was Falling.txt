It was life all around her who saved her in her decline
For they knew the sacredness of living
Could be found in what survives beyond where one tumbles

For what fell heavy as red through the transparent blue
Were three hearts that beat as one
Six seeds and three minds that would see and seed all mankind
And inside her was heard whispering prayers,
They spoke of life in breaths and throat tones in time and in unity
Of a promise so complete there could be no barriers with water or gravity
Only conduits to powerful relations

Incased inside a falling mother
The twins were the potential future life of Anishina
For they possessed the balance of dualities in life
To fall from any weathered sky
That replicated and mirrored equal parts of body and spirit
Required to complete life

Like the way a day to a night builds the shadow from the light
As objects are lit from every side their shadow falls to the opposite
From the up to a down holds the measure of life in its weight
Of how fast one's life is traveled with the pull to the ground
Where the Blue meets the Red Roads is the treasure inside
For that is your centre your heart your home
It's what you've arrived with and what you'll leave with
It's all you'll ever own but what you might never know
For the North is to South like the Spirit is to Body
The juxtapose is known through the right heart

They were falling heavy with bodies to a watered South side of Red
The two inside the one
Through the blue the promise to come
And the truth was
That Skywoman would trust many along the way
To build and create a world on top of Turtle
She would work together and find solutions with all those around her
That she would not be defined by that fall
But rather it would be in her landing, her relations, the stars and the people
That would be her legacy to us all.
