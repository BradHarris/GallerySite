In a spiritual path
That is up through her growth
The journey in that day and night
From East to West
From where we greet the sun
To where we leave him
And all the times we seen him leave us
Will be all the paths and the good red road we
Travel on in our growth rooted on this Earth
On our way Up to meet
Our Creator the Great Mystery

To become a part of Him
What our branches teach
Is until we become that many pathed journey inside
We must reach for Him
Cycling around
Every year
To where the branches
Push through and out and meet the blue
To become what our journey
Here on earth was meant to be

It is a push to be more
Through spirit and clan
Experience to understand our own truths
That the Red Road is to Experience Life from the ground up in a good way
And the Blue Road is to Spiritually Understand the ever after is more
And where they intersect
Is where you'll find your heart, mind, body and spirit balanced as one
