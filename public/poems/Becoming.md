What sort of map is this
that keeps us traveling
the reach
forever becoming
on the becom0ing map.

Reaching and hoping
within the blue
we are like the trees
rooted on Mother Earth.

Together
we are bound
on this ground
but I can't help
reaching up
in this direction
for its pull is
stronger than the North
as it promises
what can be.

As I grow into the sky
and am lit
by the sun
I travel the hoop
the cycle, the circle
that commands earth mother
to turn and darken
as a day dies to the night
the darkness is reborn
lit by a moon
only to be slain in the morn
by a lightness conceived
out of sun
born of today.

Becoming
stretching
for what the sun might light
a life purpose
bent on hope
turned by a gift
the Sacred Hoop
directs my journey
Spirit messengers
advise along the way.

Outside bark
protects our centre
is not our core
covers what is deep
and travels below earth's floor

Roots
anchored deep in earths belly
we can reach
and won't
breakdown
in a wind storm

We can't depend
on our bark
to get by
we would never develop
what is needed inside

A hollow tree
will become home
to others
who seek out bark
for their own cover

Dead from the inside out
we no longer seek the sky
content to just hang out
growing mold
with no particular light

If we only develop bark
we become alone
looking out
but when core is grown
deeply into our terrain
we are with ourselves
reaching up
branching out
rooted deep
becoming within
and out into the sun.
