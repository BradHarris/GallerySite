Is the pull of the North
The spirit place
Where a sun covers all day
And the Corn, Beans and Squash
Grow the reach in the heat

And Crow is in the middle
Of it all
For he keeps the sacred law
And knows the mysteries of creation
He knows how to be alone

And though Corn, Bean and Squash sisters
Teach the place of need
Crow's medicine lights the way with a single truth
To sound your voice
In a powerful way

Knowing your years
Speak your truth
And your walk
Should beat the tempo of your words
Crows blackness
Defines him from the light
He is the trickster that knows both sides
For he is the bringer of messages from the spirit side

The reach of the South
Is North
To where the spirit world shines
And the relationship between
Growth from the sun
And Growth in the spirit
Lies in the balance of each.
