Trying to move back
my feet have become ghosts
on a wing reserved for Eagle.

Her sight
ever forward
sees more
than I can handle.

A mind wrapped
in the band
ages of time
is achingly reminiscent
of what has been before.

Like strips of clouds
that change in a sky
known for changes.

What has gone before
is now a silent memory
one that haunts quietly
replaying in the nights eye
the one buried in the mind
to not look down
fear only distorts the future
by shadowing the step forward.
