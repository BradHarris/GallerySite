Stretched from the void
In a another world
On the other side
Pulled
From the other realm
Joined to the soul world
Where spirits dwell
And
In between
From here to there
And the mind's eye
That enters
This place
Where time and space
Are the lucid dream
But is not a dream
And the healing work
Travels
Through hollow spaces
And connecting
To the places
Where
Medicine is needed
