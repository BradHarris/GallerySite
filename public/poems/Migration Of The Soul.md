I'm inside so deep I can't see
This world is darker then I thought it would be
What happened and who stole the light?
Is that wolf or raven so alone in the night
Trying to find the moon and the sun all at one time?
Tearing through the Western Sky
I am rising up again out of the waters
By a lightening strike but I can't breath
 
I don't want to say that I hide away
But when I saw what was coming I tried to shelter them
I am the Megis Shell that guided the Anishinabe so long ago
All around these Great Lakes
But it hurts this pain because I don't know what I'm looking at
Is that the master piece that once was, or an oil slick I am landing upon?
Am I lost in this spirit place that once was perfect bliss?
Or is this a map with lines on it?
 
Where was your soul when the light grew dim and became the complacent new year
Didn't you see the ruthless working
Digging down a little deeper bleeding more then what was needed
What is that smell?  And when did the water die?
When was it we were forced to buy what was meant to be free and clean?
Were we expected to protect ourselves from what was rightfully ours
In that age of storms that were ripe to blow
Who forgot about the needed places that had to survive
 
What happened to this my life and these spirits?
I long to disconnect the one that bleeds her
But I don't know how to make them see what is greed and what is need
From that night sky falling down all around our knees
That she is our mother our ally our healer our life
The seventh fire has arrived
And why don't I speak their language anymore
I must be lost into a world that has disappeared in a dark stain
That kills anything that is not the same
Where are my people?
Did they fall asleep or did I?
And what is this poison that now envelopes my shell?
Where did life go?
And the spirits of the four directions were the only ones there to answer.
