I am grounded on this Mother
But reaching up for what is
Part of my soul
For what makes
Me whole
For it is where the Winged ones soar
Close to God
And who see more clearly down below
And I know
That like the trees
Who are rooted on their mother
And branch into the sky
Where the Winged would go
To make their circles and sleep
Lay their round shelled ones and warm to peep
Bring food for young to feed

She is the standing one
Solid and yet waving
A wind's rhythm
Whatever is in the air
Was meant to be there
This is where I reach
