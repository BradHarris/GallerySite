Hope burns true
for those that knew
of places
so tall
they screamed
of forests and streams
and easy sun beams
that dappled it all in a dream
of sun parched lands
and moving sands
of waters
so big
they squalled

I've seen these places
I've grown these faces
that looked so hard
they balled

But time moves on
and faces change
from good
to bad
to none at all

I can't go back
it's such a shame
to loose this quest
this call

It stings
this coo
of firing the want
for so many
with so few

But hope burns true
and the want is new
so the land
is embraced
with a vice
and it's face
is stretched
so hard and so wide
it divides and cries out
'No More!
I wish I never knew you!

Words take wing
travel fast
for the earth
is in our keeping
Songs that float
up in the clouds
and float the message
of our sleeping

Wake up now
and hear the pleas
of a world in need
of a healing
Hope burns true
for those that knew
of the quest on high
for Brother Eagle
who see with eyes
so vivid and true
of the living arched and reeling

Gather high
Eagle Spirit
for a messenger
is needed
There is a pain so real
that binds so tight
we are caught up in our breathing

Words, take wing
and sew the message you bring
through the clouds
above to the creator
for there's a change that's due
to fill this greed
with an inner healing
