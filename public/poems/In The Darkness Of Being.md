In that place where
It's so hard
To believe in yourself
In that night of not knowing
Of when to speak
And when to spill
Of who said what
And why they're speaking still

And all the while
The thoughts keep nattering
About your space and your skin
Going deep
And you know it's your North that'll pull you in

Covered in white
That's blue in the night
You keep questioning the real
And the in between slight
And look for answers
Till the morning light

And then you see
From the morning messenger
That you were never right
Alone in the dark
How could you be
When it's all you've known your whole life

It's knowing the difference
Between beggars and meals
One's a gift to live
The other's a life to be lived
And it's knowing you are both
Depending on the light.
