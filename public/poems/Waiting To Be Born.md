waiting to live
for life outside to begin,
waiting for a dream
a want, a need, an opinion.

but for now
on hold
inside
waiting to live
a part from
yet
part of another.
who are you
you might have beens
if you had the might of being.

I store you
half of you inside me
a life of all the possibilities.

then
before each moon
you are poured outside
into the waters of life
washed ashore
a cycle,
the undo of yourself.
