In the heart that I kill
In the haunt that I still
In the Red that is life
In the Blue that is Spirit

I ask for forgiveness
For what has been taken
And what will be filled
In the long everlasting

Of this circle called life
That lives on in stories
What survives towns then cities
What lives on in memories
Remains in my blood
And dies into Blue

It's the way of the hunt
To kill the deer in ourselves
To kill the softness in you
While the hardness runs free
And worn like a robe
Keeps the cold from reality

It is the way of the heart
To understand first
What lives deep inside
Before sentencing the skin
For its crime of its tint
