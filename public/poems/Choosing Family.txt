Standing never took so long
For with every breath comes the mother and father
Who put you there
Then burlap sacked you 

And after all the arguments
Trying to climb free
We still listen and climb right back in
It doesn't matter how far away they are
We still climb in
And wait frustrated again 

Not quite realizing
It's our choice
Over and over again
And over again
We argue about the same things
Until you see
Those words for what they are
And break free
And teach them that it's just you and me
And the past that makes us so crazy 

Day after day
Not knowing you chose them
And your problems and your fights
You chose every cloud that got in your way
You chose all the winds and the clouds that wrap and bind you
And then you let the blue choose you
It knows you well
You know each other in spirit and in spirit you fell

Each argument is what makes you unclean
When you become life you have to find your way
When life comes you have to know how to play
And body, heart and mind in between
In the air and out
Then become the air itself
Before we again float away
