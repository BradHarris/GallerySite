Either sided
In Blues by rumours and jagged little voices
That never speak the truth
They can only be half
The rumour half ruffling
Disconnected but never fulfilling
Come around
Meander but never meet
Harsh voice sharp beaked
Crying out in his hot blue, He lies
For how could one so pretty
Be so pushy, scream back and be so shrill
How could one who dresses in sky's blue peace
Create such anarchy
For why is it ok for Crow and Raven,
For Eagle and Falcon too
But not for that one, pretty in Blue

But oh, look at his coat
And his crown too
To look at him you'd think you saw the sky
In shades of peace as white as Blue
But there's more to blue than meets the eye

We are born in a harsh world
He is strong
What we don't winter well
He'll stand up to, dive down,
Measure up, grab back and plan again
Survivors don't die
They live on to tell their story

Sometimes he is what I need
To take back what has been taken
To strike out and guard with a loud voice
To stand up and tenaciously not give up
To hang on and make my power known
To expose those who are snaking and sneaking
Sometimes speaking up is not at all
Like gossip

For the truth is clean like a cold dry sunny blue winter day
Not cold and damp sinking into bones as grey damp tongues do
Wagging about this and that one
Staying quiet too long about the right stuff
And sowing lies into divides about the wrong
And if I was any old Crow,
I'm sure they'd know
What darkened the sky long before
They heard me come
