In the language of his song
He follows you deep,
And flutters your spirit
With haunts of; you should know
It taunts you deep and long
It makes you weep for what's been wrong
But you're not sure why that part he seeks in you makes you sad and at peace
All at once
You only know he's touched your soul
And if you followed his song inside you might know
He's found your spirit too
He seems to know what's deep and echoes long before you do
And he seems to say; know..know what's deep inside your soul

In the language of his Space
He longs for the silence that drifts in shadows and in mists
It is better not to be found
To disappear below where muffles are the only sounds
It is the place of dreams that finds you deep inside that soulful lake
For he will teach you about defending your spirit
In that place that calls you by your Spirit name

In the language of his stand he makes himself big
Stands up for what joins and connects his insides
For the noise and the din will shake your core
And echo where your bones keep you raw
That deep inside the mush and gush of flesh are the bones
And Loon knows that as much as he loves his peace
He is not afraid to stand up for what he believes and raise those bones up big and clear
He knows the meaning that noise would be the ones who can not be trusted
And he must protect his young, protect his peace protect his place protect his keep
Protect his sand protect what's deep
Stand up big ~ make them run

In the language of his hunt
It is the dream that makes himself long, dive down deep inside and focus
On what he needs
He knows what he wants and he goes after his dream with all the fortitude
Of one who strives for truth and need
And adjusts his vision under water to clear and sharp
He has the power of Chieftain, a true leader
But known as Mahng; "most handsome of birds" he risks his life
In his contrasts, hides in the deep, in the dream for what is real.
