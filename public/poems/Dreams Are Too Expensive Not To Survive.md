Thinking on a day.
Borrowing for the snow.
A moment before
the air froze the breeze,
and the day stemmed the tide.

Undercurrents await the sky
with a look pretending
their dream would survive
But then the moon took the tide.

Clouds can't stay the same
They're almost there
they mutate then disappear
and a breath
is always on its way out.

When the waves flowed,
their laugh was gone
before their look could stay.

Why pretend that life stands still
when a day comes
then slips away into the night.
