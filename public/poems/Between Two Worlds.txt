Between the waking and the dream
The light and the dark
The red and the white
The pupa and the butterfly
Between the water and the sky
And the ones who live on each side

Is
On the surface
The transition between
Change and growth

But in between two worlds
Before the butterfly
And after the pupa
Is the cocoon
The sleep
The night
The difference between water and air
The place where one twists
Inside the dark to make a place
That one must spin alone
To see inside

In the East is the egg
Where it all begins

And the South - the pupa
A young one between two worlds
Anxious for the butterfly
Wants to skip the cocoon

To the West - is the cocoon
The spinning of the knowns inside of you

And the North - The butterfly
The spiritual freedom
To fly into the unknown

Then rebirth in the East again
The cycle that flows between worlds
And joins them
And then you realize
You were never just between two worlds
But part of and connected
To the complete circle of four
