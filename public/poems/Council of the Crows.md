In a line of spirits
That decide light and life begins
With each early golden sunrise
The moment just before
The stillness voided the moon
Comes the twist and shake
Of the morning quake
Wings that wrap and furl up high
That blow and curl down one up side


Half human half crow
The shapeshifter trickster escape the night
Through the largeness of their connected ride
The ones that keep them safe as black
In the blended sameness of carbon's track
The council of the crows
Know the secret of the roost
The grouping that decides
Time is sheltered together
On a branch in the sky
For the moments that
Connect all the stars
Through the dark
Into the brightest light
Of the morning fire


Twisting awake into the other sided
Beaks and flesh
Feathers and friends
Breathing is all the same
It is part of the whole
That understands
The work of the heart


For as they line up their lives
No owl will come in the night
Their closeness
Keeps their shape tight shifting
Twilight knitted
In their feathered together
A strength that is in the promise of the other
They join between day and day
But remember in the morn born of the moon
That the heavens played upon their yester-fun
And to caw this truth
