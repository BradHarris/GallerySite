In this small place looking up
I have words that you hear
Before my tongue
For they are heard in your heart
And known before the start
That I have come
And connected to your Blue
That place I knew you
Long before we were here

For in this small place looking up
The vision is smaller still compared to the Blue
And the vastness that connects to you
And the messages I speak
Reach from my heart
To the space that resides beyond this place
Beyond this sky
Beyond this blue
Beyond this dark
But everywhere
All at once
And beyond my tongue
And the connection that rides into the thermals
Under their wings that glide
And take these messages to you.
