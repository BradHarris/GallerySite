He was a man among fish
Standing rigid
Immoveable, stoic amidst the spiritual ones
Their movement, so fluid, flowing, adaptable
Mutable in the waters of life

He stood that they would not wrap or flow through
Only bounce off his solid exterior

He was impenetrable
And the fish bounced off him enough
To realize
As fish do
That if it doesn't move
Then perhaps it is edible
And so, slowly nibbled away at him

But he stood firm
Resolute in his unyielding way
Until Seeing In a Sacred Manner
He realized he was part spirit too
That everything created was
And the spirits gathered round him
And he became more in balance with
And accepting of his life
He was whole
