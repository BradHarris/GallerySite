That all our promises are
Coloured in reds
For as Grandfather Sun sets
He casts his last light
Across a day
Across Father Sky
And Mother Earth
As if to cry
'Say goodbye' in clouds of burgundy
And shiny waves that peak the dead
'Say goodbye' to a day
That won't ever come back again
So Grandfather sun in his last hurrah
Spills his colours
For the end of each day
On all who will wear his reds
He highlights the zenith
Of the water's breakers
In shiny flashes that flicker and twinkle
As if to say
Well done you splashes of wake
You rose and had your say
He casts big shadows
So all will know
Where the light is
Before he goes
And long darks become longer
Slowly warning our day will be over
Till all that remains is night
And stars and moon
That remind us
He's just on the other side

He shines on all the spirits in the sky
And all the spirits in the water
And all the spirits on the land
And on all life, he shone on spirit everywhere
Everyday he rose and set
And everyday we rose and fell
Trying our best we'd age each day

Colour our blood as hope
A red to begin another day
In rises of fire and promise
That the Great Mystery gave us
Before we we were born in red
We knew our purpose
But then were made to forget
To do what we were meant

And as we aged
We just never thought
That we did each day
For everyday seemed like the last
And it repeated each week
And month
And year
And decade
Until we thought
We always began again

But then one new day
We looked in the mirror
And we understood
That we were fooled to believe
That our time would be forever
And one red end of day
Told us
Where everyday goes forever
On this seemingly endless cycle

To the other side
And each new day is the gift
Our Creator, the Great Mystery
Gives us

Our God is, the Great Mystery
Our promise in our future
In our selves
In our lives
And the Great Mystery is in the centre
Of everything
In the centre of it all
Keeping us connected
Spinning and circling
Growing and loving
Beginning and ending
In reds.
