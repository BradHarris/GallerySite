They cross back over, a Grand Entry
Down the Blue Road ancestors come
To answer Prayers connected by blood
To the ones Rooted on Earth
Who reach along their way
In a world who see only what is lit

The bright does distract the heart
From knowing where truth lives
And when a body ceases to live
The shadow leaves a message
Of its disguise
These are visceral truths
That pale at the knowledge
That lives within
But dies alone
When we don't allow its breath
Or open up to what we were born with

How can we know what our tears don't
As they fall in silent spills
That we might never know the loss
Of what created them
But it is those tears that prayers are built
The sacrifice of losing water
From the pools reflecting our souls
The place where we see the world
Fall forever from what our heart made inside
It is seeing with Eagles vision
That prayers sent in this same way
That a connection is made

I have spent the night praying for the morn
That those young ones live beyond another storm
For I have known my life in spills
But I have not clear-cut my life for what was felled
Only that I might learn from the cut
That quells my left side
And subdues the beating in my heart
For what would I do
If I couldn't reach for the Blue
From my rooted Red Earth
If I found my self alone
Without the link to the North
And have nowhere to pour out this hurt
Like tears that rupture from surrendered visions

So I pray
And Spirit Messenger
Glides into the Blue within the circle watching
Cuts to where Blue meets Red
Connects the heart's name
To the Great Mystery
And so they come
They come answering prayers
That my heart spends in drops and tears
That I spend in years earning

Overhead, He is watching
Watching them enter
Down that Blue way
And knows, each quest
For they bear their meaning
Where only He can see it
In their mind's eye
For the meaning of their descent
Must bode well for all

A Night turns to a Day
The black marks the ending
And the yellow of a splashy start
Speaks to believing and being hopeful
To never break that circle of its giving
For each day is the gift of the propitious sun
And each night the tool for the dreamer
And what should never happen
From our red road rising
As we stumble along our way
And yet is still surprising
We forget the everlasting Blue
When clouds get in our way
That prayers are sent so that we continue
And connect to last out our days
Looking up to the Blue roads rising.
