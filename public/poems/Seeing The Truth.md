The medicine that makes you grow
Is a painful one
And you must look
And although it might hurt to see
It is a part of the whole
And in the end
It is the completeness
We set out to become


Solid and true
We cannot hide
From that brightness
That is our life
Should we want to see


It's hard to look down from this perch
To see
Where we might fall
But if we do not try
We will never become what we were meant to


Some of that fear
Just keeps us too safe
And we never explore
What we could be
But Seeing in a Sacred Manner
We know
That looking down to see where we might fall
Only keeps us there
Instead of looking up and where we could fly.
