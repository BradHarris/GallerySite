Tree Spirit
strength abound
maternal power
spreading round
roots of family
providing energy
for storms that shake
and rattle the ground
trunk of woman
bestower of health
connect us to the air of wealth
reaching high
the stretch is real
to breath the change
the world needs to heal
but grains of fibre core within
circle around and travel the spin
a year
motionless, relentless it's true
but suffer we must before
the me turns to you!
Tree Spirit
Strength abound
creating the energy we need
to take this world around
