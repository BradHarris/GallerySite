spirits ingrained in me
child I forgot
the places
she enveined in me
not on my sheath
that barks my covering
but deep through sinew
and fibrous flesh
My Grandmother Cyr
pumped a vision
of myself

a seedling of the
reddish earth
sweet and full
strong and spiced
hidden inside
the cultivation
of a desire
budding my being
into pure creating
branching me out
stretching my reach
expanding my vision
beyond clouds
that would shroud
building my quest
for blue
and for the
spirits ingrained in me.

She left

this world

a quiet begins

ancestors
they become my gardeners
they amble
guide...enlighten
directing me on
from the place
she started
taking me again
to the places
of the
Spirits ingrained in me
