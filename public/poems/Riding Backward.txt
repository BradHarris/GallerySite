We remember where we've come
When water, then legs and feet, then horses
Was how we moved on Earth
It was within this moment to moment movement
That food and shelter were found
As we traveled on the blue waters and the red roads
In boats and on red legs and red horses
The memories when Turtle floated
And movement before was slower and leaner but stronger
Remembering the prayers were for rain and horses to come
And moved together as one

Now we survive and stay apart from everyone while food and water come
Powered on roads, in the air and on water
Heating shelters and foods using gas
And laying around watching what they die for over there in bullets
And over here in diseases
We pray all the while now for peace and wellbeing
Riding backward
And remembering where we came from
