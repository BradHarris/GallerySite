Is the magic of illusion
The healing of the sallow
The shape shifter of reality
Prior to the future self
Enters the darkness
The void before form.

While wolf teaches relations
Is there keeping his pack together
Knows family
Beyond physical form

And so here the sick
Shapeshift a new realty
With family all around
The guardian of ceremonial magic
Calls the future
To bear a family's past
And the balance between
Is in the present of healing

The power of Crow's Medicine
Is knowing what is right from wrong
In the darkness
Is knowing something unexpected
Is about to happen
That a single voice
Is no longer silenced

It is to not give up the fight
And in a powerful voice
Stand up and caw what is right
The voice is inside
Awaiting its own sound
