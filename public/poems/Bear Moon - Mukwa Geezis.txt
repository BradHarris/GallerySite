In the February moon of New Beginnings
In the bright Grandmother evening of new starts
I waited for you to happen
To flow my way
I crouched waiting in your direction
And knew that you would be there
In this spring of morning starts
Hungry like a bear
I waited in Mukwa Geezis,
The Bear Moon time
To light my night
As big as Grandmother moon could be
She lit my night sky
Moved my waters shared my tides
Divided my clans that mothers provide
Split my hair forward West backing East
And watched a Winter subside

I waited for you Spring time
To shine my North clear Blue on white
In this snowy night
That burgeons a morning ignite,
I knelt there at your East door and planted my seeds
To be more, in hope, in blooms and roots and dreams.
I waited in your early morn to find my dream.
