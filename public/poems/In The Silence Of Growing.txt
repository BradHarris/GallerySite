In this deep place inside
That finds me reaching
Within the many ages I've been
And still becoming
All the mistakes I've made and still making
All the battles I've wrested into knowledge but keep fighting
And quieted now but from this distorted place of twisting
Are now lessons along the Red Road of becoming

But still I reach for that peace of Blue
That shines golden within each sun anew
That spirit place of peace that I'm not done
From where I've rooted to where I'm growing to
We are many ages in this space and time and yet only one
Incased inside this skin this bark this flesh this pulp this core these bones these branches
This one that resides in here from before
Has grown and seen many ages along the way
And the potential to reach
Past the golden past the blue into the dark
That says each time I knew
