Wolf
He comes from where the air is tight
The moon is swallowed whole at night
He comes silently
And stays just before the wind moves

In his tautness
He catches what the air caught
Tips off his nose
And paces
For clear spaces

In his quickness
He is both ready
To run and to play
To snarl and to eat
To sniff and cry
He is the moment
Just before the wind changes
And after the sun played
The dance between shadows

It is his long high to the moon
That echoes in my heart
Separates the clouds
And resonates in the long after
It is in his eyes that I know gold
For it is only his reflection
After he has long gone
With his others
That I find my soul

He is Brother to my song
He neither sings it
But he teaches for what I long
He is the other side of this one
He is the alone but not lonely
He is the shy and the killer
Sharing the sinew
Pulling and tearing into hot carcass
But always ready to move
He is the rambler and the paired
Travelling always moving
But knowing

Where and who belongs
And where and who does not
He belongs to family
In the face of fracas
He is the curling up in the furling
Nuzzling in with kith and kin
In the bitterness of white nights
He is the two sided of play and fray
Loner and kin
That balance as one
He is the spirit of wolf
And he is my relative
Relation by clan.
