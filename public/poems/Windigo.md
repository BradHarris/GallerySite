It's like a disease that eats at your soul
Little by little you're at odds with your role
Like a small itch deep in your brain
It nags for what's even until you go insane
It haunts and burns thin all the while laughing at your weakness
Then taunts your skin till you smile then cry for belonging to kin
It flowers your eyes for what might blossoms again
Then bids you goodbye with a smirk and a grin
 
And you realize what's been said
Is keeping you apart, keeping you distant from the challenge to spark
From voicing dispute
From telling the truth
And it tells you its spin from every square inch and every bandwidth
Of every net worth and every network
From it's folded and delivered to barely dried ink
None of it feels like it's breathing in synch 
Not nearly complete it's stolen then leeched
It's wasting your time with your head in a lynch
 
It's the media and the tech and amusement in pinks
It has you numbed and stunned and dumbed down to think
Overwhelming you with wrong minutiae confusing in heaps
Where trust has been lost to the glut to guzzle
When the reason for harsh weather misleads repeating in loops,
And cover upped lies keep twisting in sleeps
It's poisoned the waters and polluted the skies it's locked into waste
That's thickening thigh high
It's all that is laid bare in chunky lies
It's the corporate greed that's eating this Earth
And devouring her whole like the monster of old
The legend of Windigo who ate human flesh
Has returned and he's eating your soul consumed to segregate
He's eating into our minds with his moneyed treachery
Eating into our hearts with human divides
And he's devouring our air our water our earth with his greedy smile
He's Windigo, our very own Corporate Cannibal
Devouring our Earth, our lives and our minds.
