She holds her own
With the oneness of skin
That knows the fruit of her tree
Is still connected by the juices
That pump through her core


She holds her own
Like the bones of those
Who have gone before
And have known their own
Through the process of connection


She holds her own
Like the fibre's within her folds
That tell her
The Earth was her mother
Even before she was born


She hold's her own
Her heart will never let go
The ones who came from her
That fed from her
That bathed and dressed by her


That is her silent song
Long after they have gone
It is with Eagle that she sees
In this Sacred Manner
That she will always be their mother
No matter how far they are
In age or distance
Time or space
That is the way of it
