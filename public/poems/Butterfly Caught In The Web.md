She flies as free as a dream
This master of transformation
Stretched out flitting in her beauty
She's had courage to change
Into this magic of colour and grace

But she is caught in a spider's lace
Of a bill C-31
A lace rife with rules
And this free dream is caught in another's reality
Of what's red from a white perspective
Dividing up by gauge and filter
Who will not fit into a second generation
Twice removed once married outside of red

What is connected to her
Just is
Is not for assessment - projection - sale
Or for the taking.

How far does a reach have to go
Before a measurement can strangle a life not yours
And as the grab does
Holding in, binding hot
Containing and dividing from another's lot
It will take a vision
To the way of freedom
As only the feathered ones can see

For Butterflies need to be free
It is with a fragile grace
That these delicate wings
Will need to be unfettered

The silent storms
Of moments past
The struggle to be liberated
And yet the honest quest
Will not be honoured
And her fate is relegated to rules stretched out from another

Feathers remind her of the spirit world
And the other answer just beyond
And so her friends of feather
On prayers to set her free
Are sent on a wing
Who gather in the sky
And send the wind to blow below.

A gust on a branch whisks her flutter free
She escapes the eternal one
Who works so hard
To trap the unsuspecting
In its lace.

Transformed again
She is
To be much more then just one's feed
