Soft tongues
Soft ones
The poets and pacifists
Are the peaceful ones
That lead in their own quiet way
But as I put on Moose Spirit mask
I remember his powerful shell
Hulking his way within marsh and sands
Where young are born in tender hands
That his presence could not go undetected
Like Deer can
And yet he bashes through life
Charges
And runs from strife
Bellows in his mating
But it is still a gentle voiced Deer that is related
And in this soulful place of peace I remember to articulate
In both the soft and hard communique
