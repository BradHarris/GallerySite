How long do we sleep
In our life
Without knowing that we are
The answer inside

Life billows on
Under a restful brow
But how long do we live
Without knowing we are alive

How long do we drift
Without knowing where we've been
When do we finally feed our living
And starve our nervous feet

When do we realize
That we only have so much breath
To take our dreams from our minds
And give them to our feet
Believing in where we're going

Or are our dreams
Just blissful Stories in our sleep
Kept in
While our feet drift on a day
When do we speak up
And stand up
For what we believe

When do we go to that place
That says
We believe in something
And are willing to do something
About it

It is our brother wolf
Who hunts the night
For the moon through the clouds
He goes alone
And seeks places he's never been before

Hunting and searching for what is hidden
He teaches us
To bring back
What is explored
