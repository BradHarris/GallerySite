Lay not your battle into the sands
But stand innocuous to these lands
Is not the song of passing moments
To be understood on spirit lips who heard prophesies of the Seven Fires
Chords of distant travelers and lonesome herds that dwindled
Caretaking was not the deed that loomed so close
But rather
The absence of a brittle tooth that snaps on a journey to the bitter truth

Payers were not the jokers of a tempest’s wanting
But rather the stalwarts of a prison crossing
From up on bridges that were too high up
That wept for what passed under
That was neither here nor there
But the movement of never resting
The spheres of an orb who could not slow down
The running of one who could not look around and see the footsteps of one’s own passing
Only the sands of time that come sifting down and around
Scattered on so many edges to never have learned
That the mining of me was of you too

Pass not this way again
But earn your step taking right
To not hurt the one you bleed from
In your reach for want for more you suck the future right into the past
It is much more when you don’t see
That what you steal is your own grandchildren
For this is more then your right to take
When you mine the sacred of you and me
What is connected into the ground is the totem of family.
