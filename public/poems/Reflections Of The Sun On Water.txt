The reflection of this world
To the one above
Where our ancestors live and watch
As we carve out our paths
And follow us on our Red Roads
Is like the reflection of the sun on the water
Burning out over time
The stars are not measured in our Red time
But are a part of our memories
Of what happened long ago
And when we start in a new direction
And we fear that we might sink
Our prayers make their way up to the blue
To our stars, to our ancestors burning out over our time
That they are there for us to see as we see them only in our time
For their time has gone since the Creation of Mother Earth
It's just their spirits that burn so bright in the night sky
And their memories that burn even brighter in our hearts
