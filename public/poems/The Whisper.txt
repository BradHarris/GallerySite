Star people saw you first
and murmured it to the wind
who blew sky woman
to search the reflected deep.

She swished this noise
with the clouds
and breathed into the wind
to whisper it into our dreams,
about a warning
of the changes
from the ones
who would come.

Old man mountain
jagged and coarse
high upon his perch
mumbled to Mother Earth,
a sickness would cascade.

The four legged
caught the breeze.
The winged ones too
and fought to flee from the new embrace,
when you blew into my night

And as we just were,
we heard
rumbling overhead,
rustling in the trees,
lapping on the rocks,
a whisper in the breeze,
breathing through the wind,
telling it in our dreams.

Too hard to conceive.

But we never saw you coming
when you washed up on our shores
that 500 years would need,
and then go,
before our lives could reply.
