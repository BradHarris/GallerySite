And she has me now
In her warm breath
blowing from four into one
She has me in her smells
In pine sap and decomposing woods
Fish gills and feathered fronds
She has found the basic in me
Inside my cluttered soul
And she has cleaned up what I had over grown

I am disappearing into her
Lost in her grip
In all her glories
In vast blues and haunting mists slice through me
Her pungent heady scents
and trilling harmonies echoing overhead
With berries playing upon my tongue
She is burnishing me
Into one
Polishing my sight
Into memory
Cleaning my heart anew

I step into her
Sandy warm shoes
That press my fleshy endings in her gritty squish
And then I'm carried away
In her lapping arms
Paddling in a canoe
I am aware that it too has disappeared
And it is just me
And the water
And the sky
And I can cry for the wonder
That these tears connected to me are hers also

I am at home in her grasp
Her peace has swallowed me wholly
And like Eagle
She has absorbed me into her tiny big places
Teaching me that her 'is' song
Has blended me into her airs
and her soft breezes, and lapping shores
has lulled me into her chant
until I realize
My beat is hers
And always has been
For she is my Mother
And I need her to exist
