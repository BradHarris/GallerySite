Amidst trees
In the early golden light
Eagle and Raven 
Call to the two leggeds
"We are all beginning this gift 
New day

Give thanks to Grandfather Sun
Mother Earth, Father Sky,
Four Directions, all the living,
The standing ones, the stone people
Give thanks for the winds and the water
For all of our life
And for this new day
We begin again
Older and newer

We give thanks that 
We have survived and succeeded 
We've lost and we've learned 
And we ve had the opportunity 
To feel pain and laughter 
Sadness and joy 
We are glad that we've had 
The darkness and this new light 
And it is seeing in this sacred manner 
That we continue"
