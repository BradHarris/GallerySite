I grew up on tomorrow's hopes
And yesterday's sun
Knowing that somewhere, someone
Would be there dreaming
Of a time to come

I grew up seeking peace
In places divided in hopes of finding it growing as one
And thriving from speaking and reasoning and looking for unity
In the hearts of family

But it would be in prayers
Where smoke rises to places of Blue
For those who still sleep and won't wake up to begin anew
To those still resting on Spirit Messenger's wing
That haven't made the journey beyond their first beginnings
That I find
There are just not enough prayers for finding that dream
To get up and keep walking that Red Road of would-be, could-be might-be should-be's
And like that spirit messenger who first hatched and had to learn to fly from way up high
That you will never know unless you try
And trip and fall and fall some more before you too will finally thrive.
