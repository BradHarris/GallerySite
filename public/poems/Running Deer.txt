In the red of her run
From the flare of the gun
I see you Deer
I know that fear
I have felt that target
I have known that edge and beating heart
From those who wanted to steal
What was gentle in me
I know the fun
I know the battle
But now I run
For I will not settle
For anger or for fear
I do not run in fear
But run to keep my own
From becoming theirs

It is on this Red Road that I run
Because to turn and fight would be weak
I only know peace
I respect it
And it respects me
We are weathered friends
That have been in many storms
And have chosen to hide from those

That use the chase as a spectator sport
There will always be those
That look for the hunt
That do so
Not because they are hungry to survive
But because
They see that look in your eye
And hunger for pursuit and conflict
And the win
Thay want to conquer and raise you up On their wall of collections

To stuff you and frame your head
In their ego's store
Do not lose your honour to their fight
Keep your gentleness inside
Complete in the knowledge
That if you lose it
You can never go back
So run and keep running
From the ones who would gore
Your gentle soul.
