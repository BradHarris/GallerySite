Who pushed whom first?
Who shut down the weaker?
Who makes a case for first strikes
And decides their defense
Will really be an offense
Is like saying
I am exactly what I detest

What kind of ruler
Plays by these rules?
What kind of game is this
And whose turn is it after?
When it's all said and done
Of a world in first strike disasters

Blind man's bluff is a one sided game
Blind, turned in and twisted
As only fear can be played
One is blind spun around
And subjected
To fear anyone thing outside

We can feel in the darkness
But this game is about darkness
And the blindfold is the
Pokes we feel in our eyes

We are shut out
From what is all around us
And what takes our eyes
Off the truth
And the things in the way
Are placed and controlled
In a distorted extortion of lies
Played out as only a lie can be
And as we stumble around
And feel, We must ask

But what is this?
A Mother Who Bleeds
Of her black blood supplies
Used to burn and smother
A 'More' way of life
So much more
As to drown
In her wave
In 'more' water then ever is found
Melted ice from caps
The North soon dissolves
As a hole in the sky lets in her burning sun
And we who expire and melt from this one
Are twisted and turned all the while

And who is this that takes 'more' lives?
For more black blood
Young and old and says
The brown ones don't matter
The white ones must survive
Reminds one of the red
Who have 500 years
Of eternal grieving
They said we wanted their lives
And we just wanted ours

And who suppresses the ones
Who differ and don't happen to agree
And accuse them of disloyalty
For a dissimilar belief

Those buttons they are pushing
Are the windows of your soul
And they who see inside of you
Know which buttons to control
So you won't see them at all

Not to be taken lightly
Is their fear of being seen
For they blind you with fear
So they can disappear
And to start another war
Is to take what is yours
And your Great Grandchildren's home
Will be never-more

To poke the eyes of horror
Steals away your power
They know what their doing
And how many buttons are needed
Every time they're out of season
They push you on another freeway

And then there it is
Their ultimate threat
A blind man's game or bluff
To take it all away in one final puff

An Axis of Evil
The final weapon is blindly blamed
Another's leadership will have to change
Touting a blinding fear
On every sphere

So now it's time to play
Blinded just enough to see
And stop playing with those
Who would keep changing the rules
And moving the landscape
Cheating the living in a constant dupe
Who serve no one but themselves
But hurt everything else
That happens in their way.
