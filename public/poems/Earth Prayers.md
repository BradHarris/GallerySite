All who gathered
Did so under the wings of Eagle
For the time had come to pray
Prayers sent on feathers
Were for a sick mother
She had travelled a long time
Spun and turned around her Grandfather
Many times With her Mother, Grandmother Moon
Circling and chasing her daughter

We are her children
And we grow because of her
But down below
On her belly
Were those
Who had taken her from the hoop
And were bleeding her dry

Her scalp once so full
Was now bare
So the air became thick
People were bleeding her black blood
And burning it
Filling Father Sky

There were holes in him now
Changing the moods of clouds and winds
Storms were whipping her hide
Grandfather Sun
Had no other choice
Without Father Sky's protection
He was burning through
He was melting her frozen
North to South
And from head to toe
Storms flooded her valleys
Fires scorched her hair her skin
And strong winds ripped into her
In whirls that flung everything
Far and wide

And these people
Continued to mine her soul
While the summers baked her dry
Earthquakes wracked her belly
And her back stung
From the cracks and holes

Up above was Moose Spirit
Who acknowledged the truths
That were denied
He was strong
One from the Hoof clans
And because he belonged
To the deer family
He had a gentle side
He lived close to the water
So he knew the creative ways
Of soft words and bright worlds
He was the connection to the soul world
So he found the parts within
That are hidden too long
And he was given the task
To care for earth's clan
And protect their home
With his strength and wisdom
He became the bridge to the elders
Making prayers for a Mother stronger
In a gentle way

And so we prayed
To our Creator
The Great Mystery
To help our Mother
With all the spirit helpers
And all the prayers
And all the messages sent on feathers
There was hope
That she would heal
And the winds would calm
And the wounds would close
That she would be respected once more
And return to within the hoop
Where she was once taken
