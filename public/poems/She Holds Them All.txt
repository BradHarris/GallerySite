She holds two truths in her hands ~ a prophesy determining life or death
In the Seventh Fire a choice is between spiritual and material
Her left hand holds the golden star, the stigmata of riches
The mark of greed and sickness that poisons and wounds her children
In her right, she holds the hope and prayers and ways of respect
Supported by Eagle who has held that vision to see far
For what we've done to her, we do to  ourselves
And while she holds the world, she looks up to her brothers and sisters in the sky
There are those that are lost and tired of this battle we call life
And just keep moving, looking for something to free them
But they are scrambling after their own losses in their life
Of what could have been and what might have been and what will never be
It's time to look back at all those empty spheres and discover
All life is nurtured from her and returns to her
And all the generations who are to come and the ancestors who came before
Have all risen in the beauty from her
For she is the keeper of the Fires, both of the sky, inside her core, within our hearts
She holds the Water within her rivers, lakes and streams, but also within our bodies
She holds the Air carried on the wind, in the clouds, but also every one's breath
She holds the Soil, the food that sustain life, but also the life force in energy for our life
Weighted down, hunched bent over, she still looks up
Four races in four directions and all their relations are held in her
Because you notice as you look back at your life
The love you've created, is directly proportional
To the gifts you've used and given away, and given thanks for
It was love that filled your life that grew you, and you see that, that is all
Of all her parts that have been mined and drilled
The stigmata of loss that leaks pollutants from her hands
Bleeds oils, metals, into drinking waters, is killing life
It is the drilling deep into her ovary of life giving powers
That seeps and leeks up into what begins all life
The four races weigh heavy upon her
She is suffering, from their wars and their divides over her life forces
Their greed, and their inhospitable speed for more
Each one wears the shield of Turtle they call their own
Each one is buried under that shield of Turtle they lay claim to hold
But each one fights each other, in their intolerance of one another
What we do here and in far away places, killing her, and killing each other
Has been, In all our son's command.
