It is a gift that wraps and weaves the perpetuity of life
Meshing intricately the spit from what is chewed
It never stops its giving into a dual future and past
Becoming the continuum of the circle
Cycling around, an eternity of giving
Feeding and leaving a trail for what will come again
And the give back gives forward in the payment of life's sweet gold

It is the contrasts of its duality that feels like his warmth inside her cold
Like the love one finds from a stone after the sun sets hot upon her
That she can be the retainer of something cold as a shadow or
Hold hot his heat as he shines down so far away
To believe in one's own heart that the sweetness on the tongue
Could be the contribution of so many that they would die protecting her
She is connected by the long sweet caresses that pass between lovers
The flowers and the bees
Even after they all fall down spent on Earth's floor
Petals to knees
She is there beside him, he bent beside her and it all happens again
Inside the Golds of sunshine and pollination
The perpetuation that meshes life woven in a hive
Drones feeding the Queen and the Yellow Black stripe wings
Back treasures found in flowers on legs to her
Mating and buzzing and buzzing and buzzing;

"...I am here again as your offering, I'll make the sweetness on your tongue, I'll be the sting in your heart, I am broken in your love"

And they wear the love of each other
Linked to the work of what was done, given and taken she is the one

"...you have always been mine, and I yours. You told me in my mind, in my dreams that time was the work of the bee, for I am your Queen
And I am leaving the drippings of sweetness that heals
This all done in the passage of mime that takes time
To mark her seasons that love forgot to tell us along the way
That we are the same but have lost our place in the circle of life
As we walk in aisles that shine looking for the plastic label
