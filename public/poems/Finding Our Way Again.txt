In the blue beneath the red beneath the blue is red
I come to this place
As if in a boat drifting
Between the unknown lands
Of both the future and the past
Adrift in the present
To find the way where spirits bled
Following the stars above
To see that where we drift
Is not here nor there
With no land in sight
I'm trying to find that place with no name
With a life all around and spirits that live inside
Still we search air and sky
In that Magis Shell way
Which guided in times before
When we lost our ways
So I'll listen again to hear what it might say
 
That spirit in the waters and in the Breath across the sky
A part of each other and what went to the other side
Finding that place with no name seems so far away
To find that future in the past through watered dreams
That tomorrow's hope came from yesterday's past
 
Retracing the deep for what was lost and fell
In the spirit of a Sacred Shell
Looking deep inside and picking up pieces into the dream
In a world where we are scattered and spin and sway
In a life of imbalance and sickness and pain
The past has shapeshifted into the future
While our future is trying to keep the past
 
When one by one our Ancestors struggled to keep it all well hid
Elders take leave of this world and a Culture goes if they don't tell
And one by one more medicine, by one more language by one more truth
That might have helped us find our way to healing
The blue beneath the red beneath the blue which is our Mother's Red Earth.
