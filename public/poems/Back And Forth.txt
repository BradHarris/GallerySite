And back and Forth
It is a game
That keeps you playing
Here then there
Back and forth
You try to leave
But your eyes never can
You are caught
Back and forth
Trapped

It is in this small space I know
That deep inside
I am connected
To the vast outside
That connects all our skin
And the air that we breath
And the love in our hearts
To one glorious space
Called me and you

Back and forth
It is a game
It is in this small space that I reside
That deep at my core
All the peace and beauty
Is locked up somewhere and someone has the key
But if it's not me and if it's not you
For if somebody knew
Could they please bring it up at the next meeting

Back and forth
Our world has changed
And it has us trapped
And though we know there is incredible beauty out there
Why do we keep destroying it from in here?
In our cars, in ourselves, in our offices, in our computers.
Why are we inside, not out?
Why is there paper not trees?
And if we know all this?
Who has the key to let us out?
