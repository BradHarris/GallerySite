I look up to pray
And look down for the answers
And I look inside and He's found me

Whispers on a feather
Whispers from the heart
Feathered through the fingers
Weaved in and out
Drifting to the sky
And the One who knows what we need to do
Gives us power to keep going on

Looking up searching the sky
I do not see what is really there
But my words are heard
And delivered

I look down
And where I go
Is a feather before my step
Revealing I am on the right road
Pointing where I am to go
And it is where I'm headed

I pick it up
And keep its meaning to be a gift
To be a lesson along my path
An answer to my prayer
A message from the Creator
And my ancestors
My Spirit Helpers
Who are there
Saying I am on the right path and to keep going

I pray for our Mother
And all who live on her
I pray for my family
I pray for my friends
I pray for those who hurt
I pray for those who don't have an inside to be in
I pray for those zooming within a siren
I pray for those living inside places for the sick
I pray for those hiding from the hurt they've caused others
And all those in between
I pray for those trying not to be found out and that they are
I pray because I do not see another way
To not feel helpless and so I am empowered
And I look down
And there it is
Answered
A message from the winged ones
Who say; it takes Courage to stand alone
Trapped by gravity and narrow vision
It is a gift to stand and breath the life that was given
Life is long and life is short
And it is with God's speed that we live our potential
