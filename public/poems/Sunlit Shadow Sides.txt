They live in my tomorrow
And yet sink to below
To the otherside of now
But live in the same space
As yesterday

The underworld is a place of shadows
Going deep into the soul
A timeless conceptual existence
Swimming deep into the Blue
But on the other side of Red
That is apportioned by the sun
Spinning round and round
They could be one

But I sense in my soul
They exist either-side
Of what is light to dark
And what keeps the balance to this and that
Spirits live in silence
And contribute in quiet
It is the nether world
That replicates Red
That Blue subsists
Timeless but knowing
What blood can only sense in a day
And dream about at night.
