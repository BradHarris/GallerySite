Earth prayers is a Series I dedicated to acknowledge and give back to Mother Earth at a serious time of abuse, storms, global warming and over development by greedy developers. I wanted to give thanks for her beauty in "Disappearing Into Her". I harken back to the moments of bliss she enveloped me in on a summer's day on a lake that restored my soul. How she heals and renews the human psyche through the connection of our senses. I wanted to bring awareness to all she gives us in "Remember Me". I compare her to what a mother does for her children, how she nurtures them all through their life. I wanted to reestablish the connection that has gotten lost with the tech world we live in today, when children spend their days hunkered over a desk hooked onto a screen of light instead of stream of sunlight. In "Spirit Needs Sacrifice" the reminder of what is missing to be whole in our societies that acknowledge  only the physical and intellectual and forgets the spirit and heart that is necessary for wholeness. "Between Two Worlds" reminds us of our connections to the transformative spirit of butterfly and the two sides of life. Earth Prayers is a prayer for Mother Earth's life. All of this was done with deep respect I feel for her remembering the Creator is in the centre of all of this.
