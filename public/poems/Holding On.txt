In a memory when the creator breathed life into being
And we chose our roles, our partners our mothers and fathers
Then forgot when the waters became life after drinking itself back into that seed
Holding onto that dream it seemed harder at first to conceive
When Creation was first a dream, a plan, a breath a life
And holding on we see thee rise out of the waters from that dream
 
It required an ear to hear from that earlier time
How it once was
Saw it rise into the skies some days and some nights
And like the earth, a birth of life opens up inside her cycles
A mother holds that original dream inside the seed each season
Her dreams work together with another's, in the first waters to begin her babies time
She understood storms better then most, by the waters her babies were born into
And saw within; a breath, a heart, waters and bones
The water was connected all around her baby's orb, her milk, her tears,
Connected to her love that was fused to her heart in her prayers for her dears
 
She cared deeply about this order from her first truth
Born inside her mother and holding onto that dream, the spirit of truth in love
That truth began with the respect for her life
Dreaming it, seeing it, her prayers speak to its existence
That love is within each of our bodies to see, with all our senses
Through eyes, ears, nose, skin, and tongue
Women hold an instinctual intuitiveness in their visions they see into one
 
Our mother aligns her winds, earth, rain and fire to our spirit, body, heart and mind
Living without heart and spirit in our world is like living without rain and wind
But living with a poisoned heart is like living with poisoned water
And the poisons run down without a breath and with lies
It is the water that connects our bodies to our minds
A piece of us in a peace we create to be whole relates back and forth to the universe we live
We honour our gifts in seeds we plant in others when the water becomes life
But our earth hurts each day her part of our truth is missing
And holding on to that dream we see thee rise.
