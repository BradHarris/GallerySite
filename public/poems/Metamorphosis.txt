Seeing through the shroud
Of what I could do
To dance
And flit
And fly into a night
And be drawn to the light
Is where I am part
Of this world
And the next

Of becoming
And knowing
I am a sage of new growth
I am only beginning to know
What my years have taught me

To grow old is a process
Of learning how to grow old
Like we were when we were young
And had to learn how to walk
And how to talk
Now we learn again these things
In new ways
That hurt and slow us

My movements are slower
Because I am learning the process of these changes
My mind is slow on things
Because I know what matters enough to be thought deeply
And even though I am seeing through this shroud
I am seeing in a sacred manner
That this shroud will one day be wings
And I will fly
Into my next season of white.
And the Creator is in the center of it all
