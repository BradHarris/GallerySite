Travel the skies
Travel the land
Flutter the leaves
Toss the sand
Break the waters
Slice the clouds
Wave the branches
Howl resound

Winds of Change
the future has come
blow your breath
on the winged ones

Part the skies
slice the blue
moving waters
reflecting you.

Four winds of change
circle again
the time has come
to move away
shouts of order
shouts of dismay
slam these parts
have your say
west, north, 
east then south
tomorrow came
from yesterdays mouth.
