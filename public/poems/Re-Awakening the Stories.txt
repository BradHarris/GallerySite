They're from the time before, but they've risen again
Stories told of a winter's din and fire stolen, stoked off a shadowless sun
Out of mouths, and off of tongues, carrying visions to everyone
About Creation, about floods and struggles on logs,
To stay a float and find the soil deep within
Earth torn from secrets, on a water's floor,
Now live on Turtle's shell
Lessons of tricksters from their blackness of their deity,
The true comedians of human weakness,
Spirits eaten by tricksters that were really Windigo’s
Visions become prayers and ceremony curls around ritual

It is a round dance of stories linking one generation to another
And a future becomes history from the Seven Fires prophesy
Stories change and cycle round again
They grow harder and harsher to retell
Journeys so far they wounded more than knees
Buffalos  hunted  to starve a nation, rot needlessly into extinction
Battles won and battles lost
Residential schools that cycled the great cost of future families
The painful journey of feet became the telling on the tongue
That a religion can teach precisely what it is not
That will be repeated again and again to the generations that with naught
Sickness wore death around the necks of reserves in beads of assimilation
Trades bartered lives for spotted blankets and bottles
All on the same spirit lands, with the two leggeds and the  four 
The standing ones and the stone, the water, the swimming, the creeping
And the Crawling, all bearing witness to the silent history
Kept silent in schools, in the recessed caverns, in the name of righteousness.

The stories are the tricksters, transformed into Windigo's
Once magic, now cannibals  of words, swallowed in bottles and stolen in lives
The old stories survive in teachings and tongues,
Now beat in the hearts and lands of the Elder ones, 
It is a hope for children, lost for their finding
The spirit in tradition, ceremony, dance, song and drum
For the mouths that keep telling and living and remembering the tongue,
Re-awakening the stories in a sacred manner, remembering the circle
In the fullness and the life and the spirit and the truth of where we've come.
