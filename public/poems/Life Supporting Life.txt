Traveling in Circles,
rooted inside our mother,
we return again,
to the peace
outside our bodies.

A silent journey,
deep inside Mother Earth,   
she takes
what is hers,
and feeds her living,
a life supporting life.

We shed
what we ripened,
and outgrew our form.
These remains
of a spent life,
enrich the earth
to grow again,
both in earth
and after,

Spirit helpers
guide us out
of our fleshy skins,
to travel the trunk
to the skies.

Kindred
mourn our passing
supported by a
cylindrical wall,
they pray,
and remain,
a life supporting life,
in wait,
of their own
evolution.

New spirits arrive
into cells,
inside their mother
and travel the circle,
awaiting,
a deep inside
to be born,
on a wave
outside her vessel,
and live on Mother Earth.
