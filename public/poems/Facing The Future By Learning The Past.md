What harshness is that 
That stands up into the divide 
The one that deals up in shadows 
From those that shine 
That defines realness 
In the harshest of lights 
And casts the depths into her hollows

Why the enjoyment 
She asks the one 
Lurking in the divide 
Well he smiles widely 
Why not 
When I am neither 
In the light nor in the dark 
But indescribable 
Not here nor there 
And yet I find you there 
And you can do nothing 
But perform

But she says I'm not used to this march 
And this drumbeat is not mine 
Can you explain 
Why I'm marching 
Because he says 
You are merely a shell 
And your soul has separated 
See her over there? 
She looks 
He says 
She's connected to the better place 

Magnets suck you dry 
Everything is drawn to the magnet 
So while you cling on to everything you know 
To keep it the same 
Your weight is not any challenge 
To the pull of its power 
Your weight in all you knew and all you grew 
Is being used against you 
Propelling you into the direction of the cursed

Breaking free
With spirit messenger as her guide
Relation waiting by her side 
Has removed her mask to see
Holds onto otter
Remembering the day of play
So she removes the white mask that blinds
In white flowers
And seeks the rise to stand up to the tide
