What was bright gold became divided.
What was light was then degraded.
Shapeshifting Raven blackened a day
Brought her wing up and stole the light.

What was bright, she darkened.
What was open, she closed.
Raven detested yellow.
Anything brighter,
She swore
Eclipsed her black.

Thought no one could see her darkness
Against such yellow.
How silly the sleek one was.

So she dyed her feathers gold
Competed with the yellow
And tried to flap her brightness.
In a cried out soul way
Stretching her face into the surreal
Her pain was speaking for her to be real

Raven's medicine was in being her black Not condemning yellow
For being so bright
For not being dark,
For being different in her stark.

Raven no longer hides her darkness
In the darks
She flies alone
Under the light
Above her dark shadow
Relishing her own

Raven's lesson was taught in the light
To be the balance
To coexist
Centred between
The above and below
