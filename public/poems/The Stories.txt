Spoken
They connect us to our ancient times
Ancestors are alive
With tradition
And as spirits do
Braid our lives into the future

Woven from before
Beaded in traditions
Stringing together our lives
The stories delve deep
Becoming sewn in our hearts

Spirit helpers reach
The ones of the past
And the telling
Keeps us together as one
Connected to what went before
And everything
Is part of and related
Each to the other

Crow honours Ancestors
He is behind the one who speaks
In his shadow side
Spirits come and go
Visiting, helping, teaching, guiding

And the hope is we heal from
What has returned
Which had once been stolen away
