In the time of Bear Moon
When the Earth and Moon
Shift into planetary position
Of being closer to one another
Like mother and daughter older under one sky
We are Mother and Grandmother now
Closer to one another from the time of new starts
 
In the February of cold winter nights
A gathering of Heavenly Matriarchal bodies
Come together in the age of the North
To share stories
Teaching and amusing lives told by fires
That going inside is the lesson of the bear
Life in spring is the lesson of winter
 
Mukwa Geezis the month my mother was born,
Gave birth to me in spring
We are both older now in the North
I remember my mother my son's grandmother as my mother so long ago
 
Now in the age of winter minds returning to heal,
To learn again what we were too busy to understand then
Returning to the moon of my mother
Completes the circle of womanhood
That big lit-hoop
A daughter to mother back to her mother
This awakens what's inside that knows me
From the dream world of imagining I was inside her belly
Mukwa Geezis
Second moon of Creation
That time of dreaming
When the bear began that sleep in winter
Awakens in Spring to find life from her belly
Going inside becomes the reality
To understand beyond words
What the heart beats on the ground to know
That one day
I would awaken from that long dream
And realize that all I had protected like a bear
Was returning in my sleep.
