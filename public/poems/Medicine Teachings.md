She was not allowed her life.
Her life was always holding on
In the service of others
They kept her safe from living life
Don't do this or that
At least he was living his life
Or so she thought
But his life was owned as well and they all got wrapped up
In one another's needle hole.
But this one wouldn't fit and another would get lost and be alone in the shuffle
How could she find the solution?
'Either' 'or' hurt too many hearts
And so she ached inside from the constant split inside herself
Perhaps if she went away and tried the fit
What would she uncover?
Would she find that she would not fit when she returned?
Or would she find her mind hurting her heart
And then find her heart understanding why
Filling up with constant hurt and pain was not the right fit
And both sides would be lost
Perhaps those people would return to her
How can she move on now without the uncertain knowledge of
What her heart knows, but what it can't know
For knowledge changes everything in memory and reaction
The other half to that equation is also unknown
It is indicated on the surface negative
But underneath is hot positive
These two polar opposites setup a kinetic friction of push pull
Push away pull you in
But she is holding on to all that is around her
As the nucleus of life
And then she realized
She was holding on to the people she was given
Before her time began.
