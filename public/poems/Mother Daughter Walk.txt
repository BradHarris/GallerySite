Women of the Earth
The creator's creators
On this, the creator's creation,
Take your heart
And turn it inwards.

Warm those places
That have been cold, hard for so long.
Hold on to your softness
And just be
Be - for you
And mend your spirit

The silent moon
That repeats itself
Is one that beats
A story in us all

Believe in yourself
Stand strong through the darkness
Stand strong through the learning
The journey is not long
The journey is not over

Beyond all clouds
Is a blue forever
Eternal, vast and much more
Than we can see for ourselves

Stopped by the clouds
We must know
In the blue
And keep
In the blue

For as rain falls as tears
And feeds our tomorrows,
Growing tall and flourishing
Through it all
Would be to know
The winds journey
As it moves the clouds
In it's own time

It tells a truth
That the forever blue - is
And always was
The promise beyond the clouds

Women of the Earth
The Mother Daughter Walk
In the circle of life
Is a healing journey
And the Healing time has begun

Take your heart
And mend your spirit
Take your spirit
And mend the heart
Of the walking wounded
To strengthen their journey
In this time
For they are needed
To heal our Mother
The creator's creation

And as Mother Earth, the Creator's Creation
Touches our heart and heals our spirit
In a warm breeze,
An eternal sky,
A song in the trees
The Mother Daughter Walk,
Tells of the healing cycle to come.
