<div class='quoteBlock'>The woman is the foundation on which Nations are built.  She is the heart of her Nation.  If that heart is weak, her people are weak.  If her heart is strong and her mind clear, then the nation is strong and knows its purpose.  The woman is the centre of everything...It is time for women to pick up their medicine and help heal a troubled world.

- Art Solomon (Ojibwe Elder) For the People Teachings on The Natural Way; of the sacred role of the women.</div>

It was a very long time ago, that the Creator gave the women the responsibility to care for the water, honouring her life giving capacities, and connecting her to the water.  Seeing the many women and water images emerge from the tree's creation time, I am reminded of our vital connection to Mother Earth. Understanding what heals us and what kills us, can be the same reality, became the inspiration for this series, <u>nibi anishinabe kwewag</u>. 

From the happenstance of a tree's life, I remember the cultural traditions of my ancestors: to be in tune to Mother Earth, to learn about her, to seek the self in prayer across her face of lines, to listen in that meandering way about trust connected to a deeper understanding. I interpret her grains, bringing forth a voice in visual poetry, addressing the health of Creation and her creators, her spirituality, her esthetic beauty, stories based on the original teachings, and the prophecies connecting Mother Earth to a time of devastation or a time of resurgence, renaissance and revival. 

 It is through a contemporary indigenous lens I view my paintings in terms of; politics, laws, environment, family, and identity, in medicine wheel teachings but told in visions of dreams. It is from this need to raise awareness to the money rape of our earth's life forces.  Behind closed-door meetings, money <u>or</u> life becomes the either or operating equation, the extractive industries annihilate creation, under the same self-serving hand and name of disrespect our government facilitates it in, spreading sickness and death across the planet. It seems the government is the traitor, un-limiting the reach of its benefactor, while a growing populous led by the indigenous nations are the ones Who Stand On Guard For Thee and future grandchildren.  As a granddaughter to my ancestors, my responsibility, to take care of nibi, the water for our future seven generations of grandchildren, I dedicate my painted and written voice, in luminous dreams and nightmares, inside this forest. I want the viewer, the seer, the knower; to feel the dream in words and visions but understand the poignancy of a potential nightmare; the visual voice inside these trees cry out, and bring awareness to the silence of the media, like the silence in the forest, when a tree finally falls on you.
