Lifting up the whole world
Holding up her hand her head
And those that need
Like trees do
Waving goodbye to the wind
As it goes lifting up
her branches and leaves as it goes by
What holds the birds up in their homes because they're rooted

And Forests all around
Find what a small seed must do to reach its Blue Sky
It must first unravel
Become two then four
Take root
Grow down then up
Then reach for sky and become more and more
Each sunny rainy day
Down then lift up
Root then branch
Out and out up and up
Always reaching for what the light can bright
And as the Earth lifts us up
In what she provides
Lifting up becomes the circle of survival

And the beauty of lifting up
Is that it means you are strong enough to lift others
And that is a blessing that must be honoured
And to honour what you were given
Means you must use it
Because if you don't use it you will lose it

And the circle of survival is connected
As we return to lift up Mother Earth
