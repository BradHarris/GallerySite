Two Poems of understanding follow, about the relationships we choose in life
to the relations we are given. 

From Me To You

The want the need all disappears
And looking back from these empty spheres
Seems to be the tale of one of deference
The sameness not real upon first glance
Nothing true in that cadence
We were never close to that binding
Loose leaf came unglued
And I remain stupid
Lives kept far from shoulders reach
Think we could never pump that reality
Through veins remains this disconnect
Of what's truly bleeding in this internet
My nervous tongue left blathering
Meeting up against yours
Trying to speak not hearing
My wordless speak lost on yesterday's dream
And you
You think from two ends that creep seamlessly
From sun up to sun down
In shadows and light that tear at each one
The smile not the same when
The heart went missing
And it was lost into
Binge me
Drink me on a weekend
And then drink no more
Have
Then out the flame to yesterday's score
That rose then flickered to nuit noir
On tomorrow's floor
Stopped by words that could not be poured
Into poems that were never more
All the pairs pared down to one
All the ways but never done and only one
But always one
Alone and each tethered to the nether
Not you nor me
The isolates of no one
Clasping in clouds from distant fires
Watched by watchers that could not stay long
Seeing the carnage that all went wrong
Skin to heart
See then catch eyes that match
And then find a smile upon first contact
But
Smell the flavour of the skin
A flower on hot winds
The heat on fields of golden flowers
Smell its sweat through sheaths that willow
And stem it together in hair that billow
Beat slow and quick quick
Slow and quick quick
The pumping deep of heartbeat
The dance of words
The click of tongues
Our mothers taught us first this one
Her smell up close into our lungs
In her love, her oils and water hugs
That finds your heart lost at first
In her love beating slow slow to quick quicks
That now get lost in the glow of pictured smiles
Hunched over unmoving
Hearing the breath of a stone quartz tongue
Staring eyes unmoving liquid crystal diodes
Close whispered secrets can't be written
And trust is gone separated by wires
Like wind on the field just waving goodbye
The circle of love
Has shapeshifted into the square
And the square told the light it was only a pixel.

Introspection of From Me To You

And then I understood what I saw
In that space
Between me to you -
 
Was what locked you out
And kept you in
What shut you down
Starts you up in oblivion
Who loved you in reverse
From the beginning
And pulled you apart
Builds you back again
Draws you in
Warms your veins
Chills your brain
And makes you lose yourself in that stain
 
Drawn to those who loved us
In a memory
That said we weren't good enough
Unless we were the same
Unless we were tame
Unless we lost their stain
The very one they ingrained
This love was the pain we grew on
We learned to be loved in their pain
In our parents first stain
Where your blood was not good enough
Unless it flowed their right way
And then because
It was too much the same
We were somehow thrown away
 
That somehow it caught your attention
To try and be what was said to be
And slowly the space got smaller
From me to you
Slowly the words got taller
From me to you
Slowly my skin got thinner
From me to you
And I understood
How close we needed to be
To come through the fire
Where we create the bond
From me to you
That bond that knows
Where love was when we were young
How we tried to please those we loved
How we were told
We just weren't good enough
As they were never good enough
 
And so we learned that
Love never ever meets what it came for
That tries but always fails
When it seeks that ice that melts you
And you shapeshift to fit inside it
Until you realize what made you
Will break you
And you step outside that Creation
Outside of that fire that burns you
Outside of that skin that outgrew you
 
You step outside and breath again
Your freedom
From the pain that grew to love you
And all those words that meant
To keep you smaller
That voice that meant to keep you in
Now frees you
And you're not sure where freedom flows
You only know it has spoken to your soul
And you're not sure where to go
Your voice stolen from way down low
Your heart lost in its own shadow
Has locked your mind out
And has kept you held in an undertow
 
But it's only as you keep seeing
That the one from the past
Frees your mind into understanding
That they were all
Every grand one of them
Only human.
