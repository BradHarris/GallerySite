Upon a flooded earth
Nanab'oozoo
floats upon a log.

A creator of his own designs,
from the jagged side
of human nature,
he is the sketch
of human promise;
a colorful palette.

After pressuring
desperate animals
off his log,
he realizes
either by drowning
or starvation
he will die
without their help.

Remembering
the resourcefulness of Sky Woman
he looks to the animals
for help
and
convinces one
to go deep to the sea bottom
for a clutch of soil.

Of all the animals
who tried
afraid of evil Manitou
in the abyss
it was the lowly muskrat
who saves himself
and all those around him.

Grasping for earth
and for air
he emerges resource full.

As Sky Woman before him
he blows his breath
into this paw full of mud
and creates the land
of his dreams.

To quest
for that tiny glimpse,
of the gift of talent and resource
from deep inside
and make from it
one's purposeful world
is to find
the substance for all creation,
the vision from within
breathing life into your passion
and finding meaning in your being.
