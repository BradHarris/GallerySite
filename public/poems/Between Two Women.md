Between the Telling
And the Heard
And the golden space
Of women

In between
Are the words
For better or for worse
Words
For better understanding
Words
For joy & pain
Words
Of tragedy and mirth
Love and hate
Gossip and lessons
Flying all around
On strands of nerves
Are the words

Growing and provoking
Healing and divining
Songs and snags
The discourse
Like the strands of hair
Altogether separate
But connected
And the same
Part of one
Split ended

And all the while
The sharing binds
Holds tight
Then scatters on the wind
On the breath
On the verge of a tongue

And then spoken

Stretched like an elastic
And snapped
Not to mention


The sting and the shake there after
Couldn't Shouldn't
But did
Too late for that
And the strands came loose
And the braid unraveled
And the words
came tumbling out

The push and pull
Of this bond
Between two women
Bound by blood
Sisters of the moontime

Tangled in tongues
Two sides of light
In the dark
Each with their own rendition
Torn apart
Seeing more then her
Words should say
Laughing and crying
all the while

Brought together with words
Separated by the same
Grounded by her grandmother
Pulled by her mother
Bound by her sister
The powerful world of women
