Upon a Watered World
many came to rest
on Buffalo
In a horned hoop of hope
the clans rested
and survived.

She came and offered her pipe
holding the bowl with her left hand
White Buffalo Calf Woman would say
"Look at this bowl, it's stone represents the buffalo,
but also the flesh and blood of the red man.
The buffalo represents the universe and the four directions,
because he stands on four legs, for the four ages of man.
The buffalo was put in the west by Wakan Tanka at the making of the world,
to hold back the waters.
Every year he loses one hair, and in every one of the four ages he loses a leg.
The Sacred Hoop will end when all the hair and legs of the great buffalo are gone,
and the water comes back to cover the Earth."

All were Welcome.
"all of this world is sacred"
"With this holy pipe, you will walk like a living prayer.
With our feet resting upon the earth and the pipestem reaching the sky,
your body forms a living bridge between the Sacred Beneath and the Sacred Above.
Wakan Tanka smiles upon us, because now we are as one: earth, sky all living things,
the two-legged, the four legged, the winged ones, the trees, the grasses.
Together with the people, they are all related, one family.
The pipe holds them all together."

On a watered world
it is Buffalo
that circles the claim
becomes a Totem
for the living.

It is said
after the birth
of a White Buffalo Calf
White Buffalo Calf Woman will return
to purify the world
bringing back
harmony and balance,

A need for all clans
and nations to unite
for connections
is the hospice

the medicine of survival.
