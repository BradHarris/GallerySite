They're within you and me
They play on the sidelines
Where we used to be
Do you see the connection of you and me
While we watch
We must be as loon can see
That to make our wings big and scare those who might come in the vicinity
Take a look at what is true and dear
That deep inside of this place that we reside
The smallness becomes the bigness
To protect what  we risk the loss of what could be
The future of our love
That something so rare and few
Could disappear forever

I saw up in the sky
In clouds that shaped on top of blue up high
Messenger protectors of Loon and Bear
That even they couldn't stay
But spent their time giving their outlines in our minds
To keep our children close at hand
And learn the wings of our empty lands
That they are in our keeping
Like Loon who becomes the largeness of his span
And faces the world of his hidden stand
That once it falls it kills in smalls
In lonesome voice that flutter the water as he calls
To find the courage of what could be kept
That needs the keepers of what sleeps and rests
And plays, the small and the rare
The beauty up in his lair
That protects like loon and bear.
