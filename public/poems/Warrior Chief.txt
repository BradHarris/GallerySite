In a Circle of Water
In a Circle of Earth
In a Circle of Wind
In a Circle of Fire
It is these spirits that sustain life

In a battle for the earth's own
He holds on to the Water and to the Wind
And balances the Earth on his breath
While holding the fire below
It is a balancing act to save a planet
And what has been misused so

So he says a prayer of welcome and thanksgiving to these
And all living things
That they may continue
In a world of dysfunction
And consequential destruction

With his breastplate
He protects his heart
He protects his lungs
He protects his stomach
He protects his liver
For he needs the winds for his lungs
To breath
And he needs the earth's food for his liver
For energy
And he needs the water for his stomach
To bring fluid to all his body
And he needs the fire for his heart
To keep him strong in his resolve to be true and to continue on.

He is in a battle for Earth's own
From those that would burn, and poison
What is needed for every animal, person and living being
And it is seeing in a Sacred Manner
That Eagle offers his vision
To find reason and revolution
To re-order the balance
In a world that counts the inanimate
As places of power
And does not seek any further then
The inside pocket.
