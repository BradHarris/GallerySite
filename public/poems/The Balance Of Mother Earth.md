She is, that her keep is both in the soil and of the sky
She gives address for roots that send leaves high
Connected by water and solared by Grandfather sun,
Changing the seasons
One by one
We are that of soil and sky
Beings who live and pray

She provides, that all the creatures of creation
Of the Creators hand
Beings of spirit
Would live onto her land
She listens for the Creator's moment
And connects to His breath
She does what she is meant to
She is beautiful
In her living
And in her death

She sees in a Sacred Manner
All that one supposes
That we will continue in a cycle
In her circle
That we all remain
In her good graces
Is the miracle
She continues, that our prayers are answered
That we continuously pray is
The balance of Mother Earth
