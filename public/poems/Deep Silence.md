As time
begets a day
this even place
where the unknown time
spent under the layers
of dark
emit happenings
and journeys
solve problems
and forecast.

Prayers are cast
and then
rejoined in time
drifting and casting about
reaching but not arriving
in a floating space
slow
than fast
as the one who watches inside
records our journey

For what words can not say
the known in the heart
becomes the spirit teacher

A circle of moon's light
falls gently
onto the silent
layers of night
until it is caught
at the end
and grasped
in the quest to remember

Under a moon
of unquestionable patience
a telling is stalked
upon first light

And as time begets a day
we come again
into this quest of time
when deep silence
slices into our night
lit only by
the dripping gold
of the moon
into the hand
of morning
