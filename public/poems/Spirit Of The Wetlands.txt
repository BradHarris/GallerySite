Where logs rot
And grasses grow
And babies hatch
And clean waters flow
It is where geese, loons and fowl go
Where the breath of God
Bleeds hot with love
Deep within the womb of Mother Earth
Waiting
For Mother Earth's water's to break
Over a Spring of new morn starts
Where yellow mists, breach the crawling with the flying the hopping and the swimming
As they move on their separate paths
And it all begins
Within the Sacred Wetlands
