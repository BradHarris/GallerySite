We are  scattered
Everywhere
Like lies that watch from a distance
Eyeing the accusers
But  know the truth
Unseen
We are like the wolf
Hunted almost till extinction
For what we keep
And now we hide so nothing else will be lost
Closely connected we know our own
But we have been hunted all this time for our hom

We are the same as Wolf
It is the heart that knows its own beat

We used to speak as brothers do
Before all trust was gone
We are like split up wood in a forest of trees
Drawn to the family we know
But rotting on the floor we call home

These places know the language of the wolf
For I have seen the family of the alone that are never lonely
Many  seek out this space
That curls the smoke and honours the blue
That sees in a mind's eye
And travels and hunts for the peace inside
But we are scattered in many places in many hearts
And we know why
We were forced to leave and stay there
But we know what matters most is to gather

That we all belong whether wolf, martin, beaver or bear
Blue eyed or blond
It is the heart that finds its one
And it is from there that we speak
And have something to say
That no matter where we are in life
It just takes one to care.
