Skies are melting icy tears alone in places mourning
In watchful painful ice born memories dripping torn forlornly
Helplessly we watch the pillage taking place North bleeding softly
Taking stealing and conquering for more then is really needed
They take, we watch and pray and barely see while sleeping
That our true north strong and free is really weeping
No longer free from the burning and clearing
Tar sands and mining
No longer strong from where it once stood white glaciers hard as rock
No longer free as women were a nation honoured for our walk
She dissolves quickly now
Only taking thirty years of disrespect after thousands of years, drown in suppurate
 
Say good bye to the fish who leave their stain
Of where they die up floating
Where North meets South in a wash of lies
While they stand there gloating
Oil slicks way down south carried North in global warming
On particles of acid rain from winds drifting as only a stranger does haphazarly
Then leaves the mess, leaves no shape, in a liquid poisoning
Raining down melding places together all the same
 
While she we the women pray crouching low for her wellbeing
But in our minds we standup tall in honour of her life and beauty
Try to keep the waters from running through our fingers
Keepers of her crouching low
Holding onto glacier snow
Melting fast, we can only pray alone
For what they owe our lives in their ignorance.
