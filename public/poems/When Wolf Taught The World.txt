When wolf taught the world
Of what is to come
And what was done
In silent numbers
That succumbed
And hunted hair
Loner ways
And the blue that we lost
The day we lost you

He taught
Who'd be here
Left to pray
And where to look
In the deep lit day
To find one's peace
And make it stay
And when to come
And when to go
And not to care when others don't
To know the want
But find the need
To stay with one
Though battles bleed

When wolf would talk
He doesn't now and never will
For we are never still
And when will we wait and listen
For what is left along the trail
And stay long enough to pray

In the white blue winter
Of his North
It cuts as a knife
The space in between
As he continues his divide
And takes his leave
It's dead to us now
If he ever knew
If he ever dared
It is dead to him now
As the Red bleeds to white
