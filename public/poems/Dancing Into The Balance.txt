Remembering when the dance was the night behind walls
Spin round again in a hoop dance horse backwards
Like the spirit of the animal after it runs to the sunrise
And keeping a little bit of that light as it returns with new knowledge
Remembers her spring was living off different divides
In moments of the same day that kept changing
Identity that hides a family inside a spirit and words left for finding
 
North runs straight down my tongue in words that were meant for winter
Red attaches a tree outside in the sun and says wait for summer
Grows memories in the roots who grew a season of buffalo and wolf
Like the eagle that sends spirit messages inside another
And the mind who sings the songs from a different time
Wolf clan knew when I lived in another age under the same sky
Balancing yellow red white into black
Dancing for our relations twisting turning back
 
Balancing a future into the past from solitudes alone in the red and the white
Holding on and balancing a grandmother and a mother in a dark night
Coming down low soft upon her but lost in the tides she aligns in me
Dancing into balance seeing all the ways we once were glorious and free
A culture not locked into money or commodity
Not locked into identity
Being measured devalued carded divided discarded
What other race has been judged on the three darks or quantum
On the visual physicality incompatibility to our spirituality
 
Balancing the life force of our seeds of sovereignty
To be who we were meant to be in the wholeness of our ancestry
In the value of subjectivity we return to the hoop dancing back healthy
Who we were meant to be as women a strong part of the whole equally
Who we were meant to be in the dream of spirituality
What our ancestors died to survive into seven generations of family
Balancing the sun and the wind into sovereignty
Freedom to eat and drink from the land without being poisoned in money
Dancing into Balance
Glorious and Free.
