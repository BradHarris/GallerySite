Cree Teaching

It is in this secret place of Kanaway hitowin, That we take care of each other's spirit
Within my heart, Grandmother pulls me back through my ages, and guides me into yesterday
She's moved my waters, she's changed my tides
Cleansed me emotionally, corporeally in every disguise
She's captured my essence and spun it sideways
She's shared her soul with me, in a face that lit my dark sides
Coming gently into my night, she saw what I was made of, and broke me,
Saw what I ached for and brought it to me
Like tides that pull and shift, she washed over me and over me
And then she watched over me and over me

And I find in these waters, I'm searching for you
That my right hand reaches and finds Bear Moon
For that little piece of February
To know the spirit, that teaches what's beyond the beyond
Seeking the rights of silence, in visions, quested from fall
When speaking without a word is known without being heard
Understanding what wasn't said, and hearing, like Bear, inside the ground instead
I Anticipate her distance in evening black
I Embrace a powerful night of cold and dark shellac,
Because reflectively, she is my Soul right now, I stay here, suspended
For I'm in my last season and for all my final reasons
She has changed me, all the way into my heart,

In the 4th moon of April, out of my mouth comes Sucker Moon
She finds my tongue and purifies it uncensored
Like a fish seeking the spirit world she cleanses this Mother from ruin
Returns here to clear a path, for all the spirits and the ones of the water
To seek the ways of the healed healers
It is the Freezing Moon of November, and every creature prepares
In a time where Star Nation is near, and we plan for Spiritual ways
Like a bear going inside, he grabs hold of  September Corn Moon to last him a long time
Teaching the youth, like rows of Corn, seeding the minds of time
And it is over the winter that the offerings, she's made of us, must rise

But the twelfth Moon of December is the one that pulls me,
She's this Little Spirit Moon that has my right leg, teaching me in a good way
To see and to have good health in body and mind and share it with my alls
She teaches me to have the purest of intentions by walking it tall
She pulls me Westward to grow into that good Red Road and not fall
And Like all the Moons she's ever turned, surrounding me by her every curve
In Spirit and Bear, Sugar and Sucker, Flower and Strawberry,
Raspberry and Thimbleberry, Corn and Falling Leaves,
Freezing and Little Spirit and the Big Spirit of The Blue Moon,
She's my Grandmother, She's all around me, She always has been,
In all the seasons in this secret place of Kanaway hitowin in every year without fear
