Gathering at the Dome
Next to the Seein' Tower
We are at last together
We are so spread out
In a city so tight together
We move where we can
But it is the yearly Powwow
That we all come
From our concrete shadows
To celebrate as one
And it is our spirits that you sense
As you pass by
It is the warmth and humour that you know us
But seeing in a Sacred Manner
It is where we're from that defines us.
