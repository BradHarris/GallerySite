Guardian Bear
holds back the rain
and all around
a red sky
and doubt.

She pulls on tight
on her head
this bear
who comes in the night
a seeming darkness of clouds
a warning of storms
in her last season.

But playful bear
balances this juggling
of life
of what's to come
and what must be done
with what is provided.

And his humour and fun
defuses the rain

for though she is wet
there is the red sky
promising sun
in a new reason why.
