All around and hard to find
Were the answers
But they were
Always there
Inside
It was only the skin in the way
And a mind that ran away
Making truth hard to find

When the spirit
Exposed the truth
The mind fled
Leaving the body in charge
It blocked the answers
With overindulgences
The senses
Who loved the physical wants
Comforts and easies
Mind poisons
Hot desires
Distorted the truth
Changed reality for its sake
And the body was giving the orders

It demanded too much excess
It needed more
Filling more the spaces
Pushing the spirit deeper inside
And the mind ran from the pain
That hurtful truthful pain
And the only thing the body knows
Is how to have more

So the pain was sated
By using the body through passions
The truth was ignored
The mind bypassed
The spirit pushed further down
And Deep inside
Sickness invaded the body through
The excesses
It reached the mind by ignorance
And the emotions by craziness
The body took the abuses
The mind never learned the truth
And the emotions flailed away in all directions

Reaching up
From the down below
And calling out
For the Blue Road
Are the Prayers from within
That the outside shell
Has to die just a little
So the spirit can be
More in balance with the mind,
The emotions and the passions

When the mind directs the emotions
With the truth found in the spirit
The body responds to needs
Not wants
Is part of the whole
Not controlling the whole

The mind realizes
All must be in balance
And any part
That over benefits
Depletes the other
To deny the body
Is to grow the spirit
To deny the emotions
Is to grow the mind
And all must be in balance
Or the soul dies a little
Each day

So in a sun dance
Or a sweat
A vision quest
Or a fast
In any manner of pain
Prayer is needed
To crack the shell
And free the spirit
To learn the truth

Spirit is the shadow and the light
The anchor that holds the night
It is the dream
That holds the answer to our being
It judges not
Colour, beauty or right
It holds a shape that keeps changing
It flickers
Is silent
As it holds the truth
Plain and clean
Without judgements
Is the weakest of the four
And all the more important
That it survives
