Trouble is a four letter word meant to disdain most
But Trickster knows only what he needs to do to change 
And Bear is Mukwa is the police, the protector and also healer
Guards with her nose to the ground and finds what heals in herbs along the road
Transforms, in a holistic way, teaching a restorative truth of connection
Requiring all its people be healthy in mind, heart, spirit and body, 
Healing the trust in one and the forgiveness in another transforming relationships in each other

Under the arm of the trickster, Nanaboozoo, that great shape shifter who knows both worlds
That gray hare who knew what he didn’t know he was learning, wakes up that bear into the spring inticing him with a fish in one hand and butterflies all around
He holds all the laws, that protector and healer bear brings
Fish and butterfulies; the intellectual and the transformer
The trickster knows its time for 
The Sacred laws and the Natural laws, protecting places of spirit and earth 
The Customary laws, the Positivistic Law and the Deliberative Law
Protecting customs, leaders and inclusive to hearing all voices

Sniffing to the west, inquisitive bear remembered the fall season, inside a dreamy lair
Heard it into the darkness that a winter’s fire of stories were told inside
Born into rocks that cannot be erased by anyone’s book of white pages 
Connected to the earth inside Natural and Sacred Laws
The stories were told inside the land, in smoke and smudge 
Of Muscrat and Otter of Skywoman and Nanaboozoo 
Grandfathers remembered in the past of rocks and cliffs and high places
Of that time of struggle alone and hiding, Soulless they died seedless 
Diseased in winters that would freeze, they starved on wounded knees 
Crawling into places, that Ancestors stood alone in the dark protecting
Butterflies now emerge from cocoons of deep biding 
Some are still wrapped in that darkness of no moon
But others now rise ceaseless, transforming, for this spring season
Freed from tethered snares, are transformed, fetter freed, into those that dared
A culture hidden does not stop growing in a cocoon, when the heart is still beating
One day emerges into the spring of new knowledge, stronger from the times in silence thinking
Of all the broken pieces, becoming pieces of healing
And like that mother bear, who becomes a mother after sleeping inside her work creating
Emerges into freedom with her babies looking for the food that will sustain
Freedom with Natural Laws to not be poisoned or jailed in resistance to those mining the places we live 
Freedom with Deliberative laws for our voices to be heard in, 
Freedom with Sacred laws to honour the places our ancestors are buried 
Freedom from those rules that keep us tethered to another’s nether 
From an adversarial system meant to punish and satisfy revenge 
Rather then Holistically care about community, a society with  Customary and Positivistic Laws
Sovereign, in our own laws and constitution, that honour every voice, in Deliberative laws
Armed to the bears, to butterfly free us, to the dream that recognizes, where transformation begins 
In the arms of the Trickster, in the women, the Anishinawbe Kwewag, 
Freedom to heal, to be healthy, to respect all life.

And also, dedicated to the 2010 young women at Rocklyn Academy in Rocklyn, Ontario, Canada where this raw piece of wood (below) began its journey of freedom.
