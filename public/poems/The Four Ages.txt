As the yellow sun rises
From the earth
A baby is given to the world
In the spring of new starts

Looking up, growing into the summer
Of his adolescence, the hot red noon day sun
Straight over head
Reaching up, growing into the autumn of his middle age
Is the setting red sun in all it's brilliance

Looking out of his wise eyes is the winter of old age
The sun has gone to the other side leaving black
And all his darkness
Except for the white snow of his hair
And Seeing in a Sacred Manner

From the earth we rise
And we continue
To rise
As spirits to the other side.
