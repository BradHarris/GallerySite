In a breath
In a word
In a vibration
In a sky
In a day
A wind blows
And moves a thermal
That take wings on a glide
And though we rest in Earth's circle
We know she rides within Moon's tide
Smoke rises on the air
And creates what smudges
What clears and survives
What frees up in heart and mind
To move in ways
That spend time searching and lasting

And when heavens blow
A spirit song is taught
To vibrate on the air
One that is known
By the winged ones of the sky
And heard by the ones below
And as she exhales
In a moment
A truth is known on the leaves
That though the cleansing comes in smudge
The leaves clean the air for the lungs

And it is our looking up
That tells the truth
That through the Sky
Clouds get in the way
But blue reverberates behind always
Lit by Geesis; Grandfather Sun
Who keeps all within his reach
We are thankful we are the warmest ones

And as we pass by him
Wabun Ninggabeun
East to West
A day to a day
And in between
A night sky
That finds where he resonates
On stars and planets and places within his reach
We keep his shadow close
Because we know we are partly
The makers of that dark
Where Geesis goes
As he doles out his last light

It is where the Ninggabeun winds blow
It is when Autumn glows
What harvests we stow
And as storms show

It is from the West
That middle age grows
That is the time we slow
And get ready
To go inside
And respect all relations of the Sky
And we be thankful for the Creator
Who keeps creating the mornings
That begin each day
And that we
Who are still alive
Keep remaining to see her blaze
