I know where my mind wants to flow
Where open rivers tumble and roll
I want to be on that same ride
With geese and foul and the fish and me an animal
In the water splashing freely
Beside and seemingly knowing where the flow naturally goes
Becoming beckoning with its sweet melody
Of gush and splash
For it will close up soon enough just like the others
Who were forced to flow into a poison swallowed whole
Into that solid toxic waste
Maybe it’ll be different to remember life’s need as some did
And keep flowing and rambling in conduits that vein into tributaries
Finding more ways to be because of our need our water connection
 
But I forgot what I just remembered
That pull then the shove that call then the wait
The words all covered in flies
The taunt and the tease the look the disease
The scum lays on top the passage of ease
Carried along the stream by the work of below
And the work of below who waits for a sign from above
Some lowly exchange of what it gave in money and sleaze
The scum lays on top and words all covered in flies
Decisions are made and they know what’s expected
To stay resting on top give more of the same
The words all covered in flies
The taunt and the tease
The look the disease
How do they know
Or maybe they don’t
It’s just in their blood to step inside and then leave
The corporate mind watches and collects its gold
The government tells the lies
While all life falls down and dies
Their words all covered in flies.
