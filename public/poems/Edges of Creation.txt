Living on the edge of light
Live the spirits of the night
Spirits that bring sight
Fireflies illuminate the edge of twilight
And remember the day they called night
 
And with Flames that rise in a dance
The Sprits of light are this side and that
Of shadows and night that end the beginning stark
With the Lights explaining the dark
 
Sparks flit and dart by chance
Across water’s reflection they parlance
Taunt in dying embers they remember
What they gave in the night without a fight
Trails smoking then choking off flying cinders heady and sultry
Each time they sing stinging into waters rambling
Their long whine, a lost memory sinking to a watered bottom
And into our memory of sights and sounds and smells
Their message, Life is instantaneous
 
On the edge of a river where waters fall
Down rocks craggy high in Escarped relief
Where life becomes the chair the drink and the place
Where waters become the ambience on the forest dank
The refuge animals partake in a drink
Where smoke is created in its fire extinguisher
For what could be a blaze is the final distinguisher
 
Living on the edge of smoke
That stays for just this moment wafting
Sailing up to the Creator in Prayers and Smudge and smoke leaving
Is the memory of where fire began and lived
Living on the edge of the forest dream
Comes Spirit of Bear from the smoke of stories
Telling tales of his dreams from his hibernate

He leans in tight saying “Look across the forest”
Saying “Remember your dream when you awake”
 
The Edges of Creation
Are places where families unite
Into that union of smoke, water, forest and fire
You become the love lights when you play inside life without tire.
