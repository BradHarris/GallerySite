Gitchie Manito
Took the four elements
And blew his breath into them
He took the earth; Ahki
And the water; Nibi
The four winds; Niiwiin Noodinoon
And the fire; Ishskwaday
And blew his breath through the Megis
To create Anishnawbe, Original man
And lowered him to Ahki
He was the likeness of Manito
But in a natural sense
He was part of Ahki

All tribes come from him
We are all nee-kon-nis; brothers
Only separated by different languages
We are all part of the Giwtashskad; Circle
It is Manajiwin; Respect
Which will keep us together
And it is with Gwayahkooshkawin;
Balance that will keep us right
And within it
Gitchie Manito is
In the Nawayee;
Centre.
