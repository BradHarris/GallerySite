The feet remember
The heart beat of a mother
Pressing down on her red
With the sound of the drum

It is heart of the earth
That beats so long
And the jingle that call to heal
And the grass swish
The feather whooshes in your spirit
And a shawl's swirl
And a hoop flashes connection
That I wonder
How my spirit knows such things
And the spirit colours remember who in person
And it is all one in the dance

Hunching over heal toe
And over again
Until it passes through you
And your body knows where
Your every part will be
The song resonates in your ears
The drum to the feet
The earth fills your soul through your endings
And every muscle remembers
And responds to your beginnings
And who you are and why you're dancing
And you are
"Seeing in a Sacred Manner
The shapes of all things.
In the Spirit".
