Connected,
centered,
drawn in
and in good relation,
I belong to all that is,
all that is around me.

To the ones of the sky
the ones that sprout
the four legged,
two legged,
I am bound
rightly and entirely
to you..

I am connected
Earth Mother
by my blood
my breath
my spirit.

To the feathered
the furred, the petalled
the scaled, the leafed
and the shelled;
my skin seeks you out.

The shell that protects you
becomes the wall
you must break
to be free.

Balled up in membranes,
incased in your white,
growing your strength,
you were given the one weapon
that will crack your cell
that grew you,
and fly into the blue of your life.

My very strength
is tied to Turtle Island
as the False Face that covers her,
meant to torment her
and torture her,
now needs to turn and heal her.

And through it all
my eyes turn inward
as I connect my vision
to my brother hawk
and seek the birth
of a healing nation.

He pierces my flesh
and draws the red
that says;
'I don't need to see
when I trust in the Unseen
and the known
inside
of me,
for I've broken through my shell
and flown the blue inside
and learned through pain
that I don't need to see blood
to learn the truth.'

I am connected
by my blood,
Centered
by my breath,
and drawn in
by my spirit.
