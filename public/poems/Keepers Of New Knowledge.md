Pragmatic dreams are the salt by which I live
Catching a cloud mid way in the mind's eye
Before it drifts into another shape
Catching this meaning upon first awakening
A truth an understanding, a future unravels
And the journey continues
But I wait on the periphery retaining perspective
A transition out of the past from those sunset eyes
They transform what I see in ancestry
Knowledge from an old spirit who saw before I was born
A time reflected in the mind of a watered eye
From the time of Creation from an old turtle knowledge
Reflecting back to me
Of seeing the middle between east and sunset skies
That looks through new eyes
Where the knowledge of the East was where the future flies
Together with places from the past to make sure we last
To see in all dimensions the upper and lower worlds
 
If I become too immersed too near
I know I won't see the course ahead too clearly
So I hover above and look just beyond the dream
And see the promise to come and the direction to go
I try to maneuver the clouds, with any movement I can muster
But the clouds just don't seem to be moving to the degree I need
Spirits say 'be patient' 'the time will come' 'it will be right'
That the very nation stolen will be the one to heal the earth
The very weak and beaten the women will be the healers
The heart of the nation is the salt needed
These traditions clean the wound
This ripple needs to wash over everyone
That they might like their reflection again
New respect and the consensus on the periphery has seen this ripple
And Is gaining momentum
And like that dream that washes over memory
So the healing goes
And so the dreaming.
