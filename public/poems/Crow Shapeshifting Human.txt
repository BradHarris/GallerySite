Crow scratched and pecked at his shadow
Till his shadow got up and ate him
In his blackness, in the underworld
He's not surfacely, shallowly playing
No.  He's playing deep.
He saw the golden light of life and death as one
Trust opened its hold into the atmosphere
And although the heart was welcomed
Although all seemed open
It would never be open enough without the connection
Because the span was too great to adequately accommodate
The emotions he hurt from and the loss that he was within
That there were many forms of light and dark
Earth and Sky
Moon and Sun
Physical and Spiritual
And it was living on two divides
That kept feeding his unrest
Between flesh and the soul
Between anarchy and passivity
Between creating or towing the line
He wasn't marking one side against another
But rather linking the heart to the mind, he went inside
And connected to that instinct
Empowering his body and heart, to Soul the mind
He listened to the raw edges without smoothing them
And found the message of truth on the dark side

He was the Keeper of the Sacred Law
Saw the dualities of life as one
He merged these worlds together and bent them
Into a place of acceptance and freedom
Merging the light into darkness he was in both
Taking the goodness out of the bad he adapted
Finding the peace inside the sad he healed
Giving thanks for what was given and leaving the rest, he grew
It is powerful to find your future self in a shadow
You scratch it enough, it'll come alive and swallow you whole
And in wholeness he emerged on the other side
He changed himself and was the illusion of both worlds
Looking down into Earth he saw the imbalance to a sunlit world
Craving the comforts of only warmth and playing in the  light
They lost their instincts in shadows hidden into what only animals know.
