Nighthawk has caught a light in his eye
Round
It is her mind that sees her daughters time
Controlling the waters deep
Reflecting
She reminds him of the darkness
Teaching of her guiding light
They are both of the sky
A spirit messenger
He can see
Grandmother moon illuminating in his eye
Carrying that message of beauty the nights eye
A grandmother's light is like no other
