And so I wear
The wolverine mask
To be strong
And to stand my ground

Because the dance of the North
Is one of extremes
Of Northern lights in a dark sky
Of long cold sunny days
That never say good night
Of ice and white amidst a vast dark

Wolverine's medicine
Teaches to be fierce and clever in this icy cold world
And being a trickster hero
He is the connection from this world
To the next

And so as I dance with wolverine helper
To join with Loon's medicine
For Wolverine connects me
To Loon's element of water,
Of lucid dreams, the unconscious and other worlds

For Loon's medicine
Teaches the way
Of entering other planes of awareness
While remaining grounded
Her penguin dance is one of warning
To stay away

Loon's dance of protection
Could go on and on
She could dance herself to death
For Loon is not sociable
But prefers the spiritual watered world
Instead

The dance of the North
Is one of going in
A spiritual place
In its silence
And as the cold
Narrows its hold on us
We grow old holding on to it
