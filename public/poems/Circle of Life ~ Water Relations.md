The circle of life
Begins in waters
Raining down
Spilling out
We splash alive
Finding our step
Begin our walk on Her

Her waters run in our veins
Her rivers and lakes
Flow to the seas
She fills our cavities
Cushions our babies
And comes back again
Into the skies
Connecting to Great Mystery
Filters into clouds
Collecting in billows
She rains down
Gathering in puddles
Filling creeks
Spilling down deep
Seeping through to feathered longs
That pull up high
Against gravity
To tops of trees
And branching out

She fills our eyes
In tears
That grow our hearts
In moments of cries
And as we birth
She flows
And we grow

And on the other side
The spirit of Crow knows
The relations of the sky
The spirit world
Where the ones
Ready to be born
Wait to be part of the storm
Grown in pain
And the tears that rain
Parts of water that hasten a day
And after our time is spent
Here
On our Mother
Our waters are the first to return
Before our bones can reply
And our spirits return to the sky
