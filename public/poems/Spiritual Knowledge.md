In the mind of the Blue
A sky that can close its eyes on you
And still know its depth deep into what is black
But lit by a sun is powerfully blue

Enough to reflect on the waters
And change it to its mood
A place where Skywoman fell from
And onto a watered world was a spiritual place
Where animals would help her live
Where she would come bearing twins
Creating a world balanced in Blue and Reds
For though she fell from the transparent Blue
She easily adapted to the solid world of Reds
Red earth, and red blood under skin, red earth under water
And her twins were the balance of the both
The physical and the spiritual

Spiritual knowledge
Is knowing that there are answers
Beyond the physical world you know with only your eyes
Is knowing that the very Spirit of Creation is beyond the limit you can project onto it
Where you can close your eyes and trust in the unknown
Like swimming in water
A place of constant movement you must constantly move in or die
Or air that you can't see but must keep breathing it to survive
Or the wind that moves the leaves but beyond the leaves it will change and you won't see it
Or falling from the sky and being saved by a goose
Or knowing to reach onto the ocean's floor to find muck
And knowing that spreading it on Turtle's back would make it your home
Because you and the animals you are with can discuss answers beyond the things that you see
You have accepted the knowledge out there like the air that you breath
Or like the water that wraps you wet in its slow motion wrestle
Or like the blue sky that is a universe black deeper and farther then you can imagine
And yet you continue to spin and breath and live around the sun
A place where even the stars that you can see are not really there
You have fallen into the knowledge of the Blue
That trusts and believes in you even though you may not totally understand the Great Mystery.
