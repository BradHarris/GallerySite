We are a voice
coming though the waters,
Can you hear us?

We are a memory
turning into real tomorrows,
Will you know us?

We are the silence
in the turbulence,
Can you see us?

We are the struggle
on a waters edge,
Will you join us?

We are a motion
coming to the surface,
Can you feel our wake?

No boundaries, no borders
we are the sunlit join
in the seamless lake.
We are the ponderous
to the deeply divided wake.

We are the silent and the spoken
the gifted and the token
the serious and the jokin'
on a sunstroke day.
We are jumping for the air
falling for the stream
covered and wrapped
so completely like a dream.

We are in and on the horizon at once
our splash has broken
in a calm glass war
pierced clean
in rippled leftovers.

Looking in reflecting deep,
find us
we are the invisible with a voice
a sound but not asleep.
