In the spirit of the waters
In a slice of watered sky
That the red leaks out and down and all around
Reflections on the relationships that cannot divide
How can you carve up water?
Separate it from its own existence?
Water is spirit inside its original dream
Is flux is fluid is Creation
And we need it like the air we breath
How can you separate what they've done from what we need to survive?
This disconnect is a mindset of lunacy
To not see where power truly lies.
