Huron Heights Secondary School - Newmarket Grade 9 - Fall of 2009

Hi LauraLee,

Your work has inspired me for years. I was first introduced to your work by my former teacher and now good friend Luisa Capelet at St Thersa of Lisieux. I do not know if you remember me but I was one of her students who went to one of your gallery events that was held at your house about six years ago. This project that Luisa introduced me to has alway stayed with me as a student and now as an artist. I am currently in teachers college and I am placed in an art class at Huron Heights Secondary School in Newmarket. I am working with grade nine students who are focusing on Canadian art and of course your work instantly came to my mind. With permission of Luisa, I am introducing the grade nines with this project that is inspired by your wonderful work. I believe that your work will inspire these students to open up thier creativity and imaginations. Would you be interested in being a guest artist at this school? If you are please email me I would love to hear from you.
