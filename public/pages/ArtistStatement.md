#ARTIST STATEMENT
	
In the footsteps of my ancestors, I am like a woodlands wanderer, without a preset destination finding a conduit for my visions.  From the happenstance of a tree's life, I remember the cultural traditions of my ancestors: to be in tune to Mother Earth, to learn about her, to seek the self in prayer across her face of lines, to learn in that meandering way trust is connected to that deeper knowing. And not knowing where her life will take me, I trust and listen, attune my inner ear to her messages, she speaks in many healing voices connected to body, heart, mind and spirit, in story, in teaching, in knowledge, in spirit.

I fashion her meaning around the complex medicine wheel teachings, finding perspective in the natural imagery organized into directional meaning, holistic and inclusive to the whole human being.  If I don't understand, I search for its meaning through the universe; elders, books, viable web sources, so I can understand what brought me here. 

In this, my journey I take a deeper look inside to find freedom of individuality, an intuitive spirit and an instinctive heart, when discerning a tree's life into living vivid colour. I reply to what Mother Earth grew there, with spontaneous colour flow, in bleed and wash, sinking deep within her grains, telling me more about her dreams by envisioning mine. These works are stories from the land, from Mother Earth herself.  

> Mamatowan: for the Cree, the phenomenon of mamatowan refers not just to the self but to the being in connection with happenings. It also recognizes that other life forms manifest the creative force in the context of the knower. It is an experience in context, a subjective experience that, for the knower, becomes knowledge in itself. The experience is knowledge.
