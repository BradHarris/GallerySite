Dear Ms. LauraLee,

my name is Cristina Soriano and I'm a cognitive linguistics graduate student at the University of Murcia (Spain). I'm currently writing my doctoral dissertation on the conceptual metaphors and metonymies that we use to represent the emotion anger in English and Spanish. I have found one of your pictures and a poem called "Anger"

and they both very nicely support some of the theses in my work, for which reason I would be very thankful if you would let me reproduce them in my dissertation (of course with all the appropriate references as regards authorship and copyright).

Please, do not hesitate to contact me if you'd like to receive further information on my work or myself.

Yours sincerely,

Cristina Soriano
