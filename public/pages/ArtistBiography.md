She studied art at OCAD and took drawing, painting portraiture at Fort Lauderdale Art School in Florida and also at the Forest Hill Art School.  Harris began to seek her Anishinabe roots in 1996, when an Uncle introduced himself along with her ancestry.

She explores crossing the boundaries of her life into art, creating work that has been termed 'Healing', she searches all her ancestry's cultures to understand herself through her work.
